But my body recovered and everything went back to normal after a few months of eating and putting on weight again. I've been maintaining a healthy weight since then. \n\nSometimes my menstruation would stop for a few weeks when I'm not eating enough because I don't have time, but when I start to take note and take in more nutritious food again, it would go back to normal. I can kinda feel it when my body is lacking in nutrients, there's a kind of jittery and empty kind of feeling. I think the menstrual cycle is a good indicator of health in women. So based on anecdotal experience, I think short-term malnutriton or undereating would not have long term effects, at least physiologically. \n\nIt probably also depends on how severe the deficiency is.",

All of these variables are associated with a higher risk of heart disease and cancer, so it\u2019s not possible to isolate red meat as the cause. Many recent studies have cast doubt on the theory that consuming red meat contributes to disease.

Something being essential says nothing about how much you need, how long you can store it or how realistic it is to be every become fatty acid deficient eating anything remotely resembling food (e.g. you can induce fatty acid deficiency in lab animals).  For example, we need omega 6s.  You don't ever need to go out of your way to eat them and in fact, you're better off avoiding them because we eat wayyy too much.\n\nInteresting bit about women and omega 3s (another essential fat).  Women store them in their hips and thighs and store a whole lot more than men.  These get stored years before a woman becomes pregnant.  The fatty acids then get used to help feed a baby.",

Or is your overall goal to switch to an overall \"healthier\" diet?\n\nIf trying to lose weight, tracking everything in MyFitnessPal would definitely be helpful for giving you an idea of how much you are currently eating. Looking at that, you can see if you are low in certain things in particular (e.g. protein, fat, etc.). But, you can also see areas that you can scale back a bit to decrease how many calories you are eating in a day. Ultimately, losing weight comes down to taking in fewer calories than you are burning, which can be done by eating less and/or moving more via physical activity. Sticking to \"low carb\" or \"low protein\" is not imperative to lose weight. It's \"lower\" calories for what YOUR body needs. That's individual for every person depending on your height, weight, age, gender, activity level, etc. You can get rough estimates on your calorie needs through calculators such as [this.](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm)\n\nWhen trying to eat an overall healthier diet [Which can in turn help you eat fewer calories/more nutritious food options], your goal should be to focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, lean protein, etc. A big key here is also variety! Nutrients are found in many different amounts among fruits/vegetables/grains so it's great to have lots of different types rather than ONLY eating broccoli and brown rice. This will make sure you're getting what you need! :) Dairy is also a great option for it's calcium and vitamin D content! \n\nFocus on \"whole foods\" rather than processed. That will be easy for you since you love to cook! For example, if you want pizza, make it from scratch rather than buying a boxed/frozen version. This way, you control everything! You can add extra vegetables and not go crazy on the amount of cheese you put on top. It will also have way less sodium! Score! Usually tastes yummier, too! ;)\n\nWhen it comes to protein, try to eat many types! Eggs, chicken, turkey, beef, tilapia, legumes, nuts/seeds, fatty fish (tuna, salmon at least 2x per week is recommended) are all great options that can be found in a healthy diet. \n\n\nHopefully these suggestions weren't too all over the place, but feel free to ask for clarification or contact me with questions/tips! :D",

                    "comment_text": "If I had to guess, which is all anyone can do over the Internet anyway, I'd say your brain is seeking a compensating pleasure substitute. You say you have a sweet tooth, which means you're getting something from sweet foods in particular which you don't from other foods, including more complex carbohydrates.\n\nAre you quitting cold turkey, vaping, using a patch/gum, or tapering off? \n\nFrom what I recall, though I could be wrong, smoking tends to suppress appetite in some folks, so that might contribute, too. Really, it's hard to say.\n\nThe question is, is this a problem? Are you overly concerned about your sugar intake, for whatever reason? A lot of folks tend to gain some weight when they quit smoking, but at the end of the day, is that change going to lower your overall quality of life or raise it? That's really only something you can decide, and probably not even something you can say for sure right now.\n\nAll of that said, if you really want to kick the smoking and are worried about the sugar cravings, I'd say take it one step at a time, make sure you're past the nicotine addiction, then deal with the sugar. If that's not in the cards for whatever reason, consider some non-nutritive sweetener alternatives, if that's more your style. They can be a rather touchy subject, and people tend to lump them all into the same category, assuming the same effects for each, which is inaccurate at best, or just plain lazy analysis. I've found xylitol to be palatable, relatively easy to get, and lacking most of the common drawbacks attributed to some other sweeteners (you'll have to dig into that yourself, since the opinions and allegations are always changing.) It even has some benefits, including being prebiotic and improving oral health. But it can also cause digestive distress, especially if you don't ease into using it. \n\nTL;DR - Sorry I can't give you a definitive answer, but most likely it isn't a micronutrient (vitamin/mineral) deficiency, and more along the lines of your brain seeking alternate pathways to trigger pleasure hormone release.",

I can eat more calories overall (not 100s more, but a little more), but also move more (naturally more NEAT movement) which probably compensates for the higher caloric intake.

Firstly, the field of nutrition is incredibly diverse and complex, with a multitude of competing theories and viewpoints. Price's work, while groundbreaking in its time, is often viewed as outdated by many contemporary nutritionists, who rely on more recent studies and data.\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, the nutrition science community tends to be cautious about adopting theories that haven't been extensively validated by modern research methodologies. Price's methods and conclusions, though insightful, haven't been widely replicated or validated in large-scale, peer-reviewed studies that are the gold standard today.\r  \n\r  \nThere's also the issue of practicality in public health recommendations. Broad, population-wide advice needs to be simple, easily actionable, and based on solid evidence. The nuanced approach required to implement Price's recommendations on a large scale can be challenging to convey and adopt in public health policies.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, the influence of commercial interests in the food and healthcare industries cannot be ignored. These interests often drive research funding and public discourse, potentially overshadowing alternative perspectives like those of Price.",

The problem with the organic label is that it doesn't differentiate between industrial organic and what I consider 'true organic'. From a nutritional and ecological difference there's a big difference between the two. Industrial organic, or largescale/broad acre organic still relies on high levels of inputs (organic approved fertilisers and pesticides, as well as a lot of fuel for running machinery) whereas small scale organics generally has a much stronger focus on soil health and managing the ecology of the farm to produce healthy food by using methods such as cover crops, crop rotation, composting, and in the case of livestock, grass-fed and managing grazing to reduce the need for parasite control. \nThere are a number of studies out there comparing the nutritional value of true organic to conventionally produced food and in the majority of cases, the organic food has a significantly higher level of nutrients. This is because it's grown on healthy soil with an effective nutrient cycling process thanks to plenty of organic matter (carbon) and soil life.\nFrom an ecological perspective, true organic is also far better for the environment because of reduced inputs and little to no pollution (nitrate leaching into groundwater, phosphorous run off causing eutrophication of waterways etc).\nAt the end of the day its a purely personal decision about what you value most - cheaper food or ecologically sustainable food. Just be aware of the source though. All organic food is not equal, and as other people have also said you're often better off getting local non-certified food than industrial organic food.",

There is a need to understand the density of these micronutrients and their bioavailability across diverse foods and the suitability of these foods to help meet requirements for populations with high burdens of micronutrient malnutrition.\n\n\nObjective: We aimed to identify the top food sources of these commonly lacking micronutrients, which are essential for optimal health, to support efforts to reduce micronutrient malnutrition among various populations globally.\n\n\nMethods: We built an aggregated global food composition database and calculated recommended nutrient intakes for five population groups with varying requirements. An approach was developed to rate foods according to their density in each and all priority micronutrients for various population groups with different nutrient requirements.\n\n\nResults: We find that the top sources of priority micronutrients are organs, small fish, dark green leafy vegetables, bivalves, crustaceans, goat, beef, eggs, milk, canned fish with bones, mutton, and lamb. Cheese, goat milk, and pork are also good sources, and to a lesser extent, yogurt, fresh fish, pulses, teff, and canned fish without bones.\n\n\nConclusions: The results provide insight into which foods to prioritize to fill common micronutrient gaps and reduce undernutrition",

A healthy diet is high in fiber, low in sodium, simple sugars, and trans fat. A healthy diet consistent of plenty of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet. \nIt is too reductionistic to think we just need to consume high volumes of top sources of priority nutrients.\n\nThis is the conclusion from a holistic approach:\nFrom this recent paper they found we should opt for more legumes, whole grains, and nuts and less red meat in order to increase life expectancy. https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003889\n\nOn estimated gains in life expectancy compared to a typical Western diet:\n\n> The largest gains would be made by eating more legumes (females: 2.2 [95% UI 1.1 to 3.4]; males: 2.5 [95% UI 1.1 to 3.9]), whole grains (females: 2.0 [95% UI 1.3 to 2.7]; males: 2.3 [95% UI 1.6 to 3.0]), and nuts (females: 1.7 [95% UI 1.5 to 2.0]; males: 2.0 [95% UI 1.7 to 2.3]), and less red meat (females: 1.6 [95% UI 1.5 to 1.8]; males: 1.9 [95% UI 1.7 to 2.1]) and processed meat (females: 1.6 [95% UI 1.5 to 1.8]; males: 1.9 [95% UI 1.7 to 2.1])\n\nBut I do not mean to discredit the paper in question. It is important to improve the health of people in low to middle-income countries. From the paper:\n\n> Discussion: Our analysis has provided ratings of inherent food sources of multiple and individual micronutrients commonly lacking in diets, especially in LMICs (low to middle income countries), for population groups with increased needs and the broader adult population\n\nDeficiency in low-income countries and very different from that of high-income countries.\n\n> Indeed, priority micronutrients are just one of many important aspects contributing to overall diet quality, and foods presenting low density in priority micronutrients may be rich in other essential and non-essential beneficial compounds and can contribute to overall energy and protein requirements.\n\n> Carefully constructed vegan diets could provide adequate amounts of all six priority micronutrients for the general population, except vitamin B12, which would need to be consumed through fortified foods or supplements. However, population groups with increased nutritional requirements, such as pregnant women and children during the complementary feeding period, following a vegan diet might also need fortification or supplementation for other micronutrients, such as iron, in addition to vitamin B12.\n\nI would like to add that all pregnant women in general are recommended to supplement folate and ofen iron too. Vegans less so with folate as their diet naturally contains more. Pregnant women should also be wary of too much vitamin A and thus be careful not to consume too much liver.\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vitamins-supplements-and-nutrition/\n\n> These ratings are most applicable for populations in LMICs suffering from widespread micronutrient deficiencies\n\nIn high-income countries there is more more prevalence of fiber deficiency, and excess amount of sodium, sugar, and trans fat.",

Saliva is needed for protection of the teeth, but meth decreases saliva production. So as far as we know, most of \u201cmeth mouth\u201d effects come as a downstream effect of the drug\u2019s direct action. But meth addicts also neglect personal hygiene like brushing teeth, which amplified the problem.

Even if a person gets clean, you can\u2019t reverse aging so if you sped all this up with alcohol and drug use and you get clean you\u2019re not going to heal your body functions to revert back to a younger, healthier age. You can heal some, I\u2019m sure but damage has been done. I\u2019m not an expert though, so someone smarter may have a better more accurate response but I think this is part of it. ",

I also have a thyroid disease that \u201clowers my metabolism\u201d, and so I have experienced what is supposed to be the losing end of this metabolism topic. I\u2019m also a chemist fwiw.\n\nMetabolism is the sum total of the energy balance from the chemical reactions in your body that yield energy (think glycolysis, TCA cycle, EVERYTHING combined). Our bodies all breakdown food using the same pathways, and energy is released when our bodies break down the bonds in our food (digestion). There is not some dramatically different way one person breaks down certain macromolecules that yields a dramatically larger amount of energy than another person. Accounting for this, there is no other way that somebody is getting energy from nothing...that would break the first law of thermodynamics (energy can\u2019t be created or destroyed). We get our energy from food, and the amount of food we eat has a certain amount of energy in it that we measure in calories (really kilocalories are what is shown on our nutrition labels in the USA, but I digress). And as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard, when you have extra unused energy, your body stores it as fat. The truth is not complicated...it just sucks.\n\nThe calculators are a pretty good estimate. Nobody wants to hear it, but take a peek over at progress pics and talk to people who have succeeded in losing weight. Calories in<calories out. Metabolism\u2019s influence is overstated because people want to hear it since counting calories (accurately) SUCKS BIG TIME and companies utilize it to sell people products they don\u2019t need. \n\nI don\u2019t have any articles to send you, but I have discussed it with my biochem professors in the past. It\u2019s mostly nonsense. Nobody is 200 pounds overweight from a metabolism issue. Don\u2019t worry about the accuracy of these calculators so much. As the saying goes, they\u2019re good enough for government work. There really isn\u2019t a huge variation in caloric needs once you account for height, weight, and body fat percentage. The only thing that could make an appreciable difference is the case of someone with a ton of muscle and very low body fat, like pro muscle builders, which would be a case of an abnormal BFP. They would need more calories to account for the abnormally high muscle mass. But those calculators were made with the average person in mind, not bodybuilders, so barring that situation, you can trust the calculators to be close.",

Calorie counts for foods and meal plans are wildly inaccurate as well.  Natural variation of agricultural products, weight inaccuracies, rounding on nutritional labels, overly simplistic formulas (just as example complex proteins vs simple aminos or is fiber 0 or 2 kcal/g?) all make your best efforts less accurate than you would like.\n\nBut the overall good news is that none of that matters.  It's the fact that you are tracking it and measuring the results.  Just the act of watching your diet improves it.   So use the calculator to get a starting point.  Try it a couple weeks.  If you are not losing/gaining as expected, it's not your fault, you are working with inexact numbers.  Adjust intake or activity level, lather, rinse, repeat.",

Frozen veg seems to be cheaper, so prepackage portions to quickly microwave. \n\nQuick fruits are usually not overly expensive, apples, bananas and oranges, and good for you. You can also make up yogurt (or buy the little containers) and add some granola and/or frozen fruit to bulk it up. You can also add peanut butter (or other nut butters but pb is usually affordable) and other high calorie extras (butter, oil, cheese) to bulk up the calories in any meal.

None trigger anaphylaxis but cause some other irritating/pain/digestion issue. I can further back this by explaining that I was once down to 138 lbs (10 years ago) from malnutrition from eating a diet mostly composed of these things before I got tested, so just sayin'! \n\nI'm currently 185lbs, 6' tall and expend an average of 3,300 calories a day (based on Fitbit data over the last month). I've had peak days of 5,400 calories out. My intake is about 2,500 right now- maybe, some days are likely 2,000.\n\nI engage in the following activities:\n\n* -Cardio boxing HIIT - 3x a week\n* -Jiu-jitsu - 1-2 times a week\n* -5x5 strength program - 3 times a week with light weights (beginner)\n* -Yoga - taking a break, but normally 4-5 times a week\n* -Jogging 3 miles -  once a week\n* -Drums - once a week\n\nIt's a lot, but I have lots of free time these days. \n\nI'd like to narrow some of the other activities down and focus on building muscle which means keeping up and exceeding that kind of calorie expenditure. Here's the problem - most of the foods that are commonly used for this are things I'm allergic to. \n\nList of things I should not / cannot eat:\n\n* -Oats/oatmeal\n* -soy\n* -Peanuts\n* -Any dairy product - so no cow yogurt, butter, milk. I substitute with almond milk and IsoPure for protein.\n* -Rice\n* -Peas\n* -Sesame\n* -Garlic\n* -Shrimp\n* -Squash\n* -String beans\n* -white potato\n* -navy beans\n* -coconut \n\nA lot of high calorie meal plans consist of oats for breakfast and rice for other meals. I'm also trying a keto-ish diet and try to stay under 50-75 carbs a day and processed sugar and breads at all costs. I honestly don't know why I'm doing that but I feel better without sugar and bread. So unless there's some reason to forget the keto thing, I can't substitute quinoa or that other grain that's escaping my mind right now (I love quinoa, but keto says no)\n\nI do eat lots of sweet potato and avocado. Just as an example typically I eat a giant egg omelette for breakfast consisting of 3 eggs, mushrooms, kale, onion, green pepper, jalapeno, avocado, beef sausage, bacon, chives, and green onion, and spinach.\n\nSo with all that detail, what are some other choices I could try for rice and oats etc? Or should I just simply double up on whatever I'm eating now? \n\nSorry long winded, but someone might appreciate the detail. \n\n*-edit forgot soy! I haven't eaten soy except in trace amounts in over 10 years either. Gives me headaches and indigestion.",

So in the case of calcium, it is absolutely essential that your blood calcium levels be tightly regulated, and even though you may have woefully inadequate dietary calcium intake for extended periods of time, your body will still be able to maintain blood calcium by pulling from stores (for example bone) and improving recycling/retention, etc. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u201cokay\u201d to not consume enough, it\u2019s just that the symptoms won\u2019t arise quickly or overtly for a long time.

            "text": "**TL;DR-ish version**: 11 months of disabling joint pain, lots of doctor visits but no solution yet. Pains are reduced from a 10 to a 5 by eating a gluten-free mostly whole foods diet. Noticed the two times I had gluten free pasta this past week my pains were reduced from a 5 to a 2 for the first time in almost a year, for some reason, and trying to figure out why that might be. Not many nutrients on the box so I'm confused. Is this just a coincidence or do you think there is something in here that could be fulfilling a nutrient deficiency of some kind? http://i.imgur.com/tIEFzrm.jpg Thanks for looking at this. \n\n**Wall of text version**: Happy to elaborate further on any of these but basically I've been having lots of unexplained health problems for the past few years which came to a head in January when a lot of my joints started really hurting. For a lot of months I couldn't walk or use my hands much. Went to a couple different rheumatologists over the past 11 months but so far they haven't found much other than some weak positive test results for things like ANA, but not much sign of inflammation otherwise. It's very frustrating and depressing. Still going to them but in the meantime I've been trying to figure things out myself as I had to leave my job and put my house up for sale due to all this.  \n\nA few months ago I started trying the autoimmune protocol diet and this reduced my pains from a 10 to a 5, and I could do a lot more but still get pains and am still limited to slowly walking. I've done lots of experiments with my diet since in search of improvements but it seems like avoiding gluten and most dairy are the only real noticeable factors. Last week I broke from my mostly whole foods diet and thought I'd try some gluten free pasta with mushrooms, then surprisingly the next morning my pains were reduced to maybe a 2 for the first time in almost a year. I thought it had to be the mushrooms so I started eating a container of them everyday for a week, but I noticed no improvement. Then last night I had more gluten free pasta with a little butter, just because I had a craving for it, but this time with no mushrooms. When I woke up this morning I was surprised when my pains were down to a 2 again.  \n\nI looked at the box and noticed nothing very good nutrient wise in there that I haven't been getting in large quantities from whole foods, so I'm a bit confused. The only thing I can see in here that I haven't had in a while are mono and diglycerides, but it's my understanding those are bad. Here is a photo of the nutritional info on the box: http://i.imgur.com/tIEFzrm.jpg  \n\nThis might just be a strange coincidence but it seems real. I do have a lot of digestion problems in addition to everything else, so I've been considering all this stuff could be from malnutrition of some kind. It's crossed my mind that maybe this pasta has a processed form of something that is easier for my body to absorb, but that's just a theory. Could it be something like that? Any ideas are appreciated, thank you.\n",

Some of the studies are more updated than others, but not all old studies are invalid. The RDA takes into consideration the amount of a nutrient needed to prevent a deficiency and the amount needed to promote health in the general population. Some RDAs are differentiated based off age and sex (for example, iron is higher for menstruating women).\n\nThe RDA is calculated to be sufficient for about 98% of the population. They are occasionally updated if new evidence supports a change.  If a nutrient doesn't have enough data to calculate an RDA, then an adequate intake or AI is used. This number is estimated based on what seems to be enough for us. For example, sodium intake has an AI because there are no studies done that found a lower limit for the amount sodium needed. \n\nAnimal studies are not used because different animals have different nutritional needs (most animals make their own vitamin C, for example).\n\nThere is also an upper limit or UL calculated. This is the amount deemed safe to eat by most of the population with no bad side effects.\n\nHope that helps! It's actually a pretty complicated and confusing process once you start getting into the details!",

My inspiration is twofold - first, I have moderate to severe gastrointestinal issues and already have to cut out many things (fried food, carbonated beverages, beef, lactose) or I get sick, and I want to see if cutting down to exclusively 4 or 5 'safe' foods can let me go a full week without sickness (something I've never done in my adult life).\n\nThe second inspiration is more personal development and experience.  Looking at the extreme poverty in Africa and parts of Asia, where people live on little more than a bag of rice and beans each month, my American diet looks a bit decadent, and I want to experience a heavily restricted diet, even if it is self imposed.\n\nI'm just starting out researching now to plan the diet, but I'm thinking of eating just  5 things - rice, beans, kale, milk and eggs.  But I'm afraid those might be lacking in a required vitamin or mineral, so I'm wondering if any of the experts here might have a substitution or addition to make it not be lacking.",

            "title": "[Advice] Need help with gaining weight and bone mass from nutritionally dense food/supplements",
            "text": "Hi r/nutrition, I need help with getting as much nutrition as possible, mainly much more calcium and calories, with a restricted diet in terms of portions.\n\nTrying to keep things short but I think I'll still need to explain a couple of things.\n\nI am underweight (BMI hovers around 16-17) and have been struggling with [ARFID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant/restrictive_food_intake_disorder) for my entire life.\n\nI never liked food and my food portions hardly increased as I grew up. Stayed underweight throughout my childhood and adolescent life and so was referred to an Eating Disorder clinic about 6 years back. Was 'forced' to go to an eating disorder day camp as my psychiatrist suspected Anorexia Nervosa despite telling her that I have no problems with body image. Had to eat a full meal for lunch which I have never done in my life before, backfired spectacularly as I threw up from feeling too full. It developed into a full blown anxiety disorder as something in my mind snapped and made me realize it was entirely possible to throw up from feeling too full. Stopped eating at the slightest sign of feeling full as I didn't want to throw up all the precious nutrition I worked so hard to put into my body. If I ignored the signs, I would throw up from both anxiety/panic and feeling too full. Before I knew it, I got myself stuck in a vicious cycle and ended up in hospital for about a month due to malnutrition. The only reason why I'm still not back in is because I've been taking 2 packets of [Resource 2.0](https://www.nestlehealthscience.us/brands/resource/resource-2-0) a day for the past few years but the only thing it does is maintain my weight.\n\nI have tried seeking help multiple times. Psychiatrists, psychologists, anxiety meds, even hypnotherapy and various kinds of [TCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) (I'm Asian. I don't believe they would work but I'm desperate for anything to work.). But nothing worked to get rid of my inability to finish a full adult portion.\n\nThe next best thing I can think of now is to increase the density of the nutrients I get from what I eat on top of trying to increase the portions I'm able to take, either from super foods or supplements. I know that supplements aren't meant to replace wholesome food but something is better than nothing.\n\nOn a great day, my meals look somewhat like this:\n\n* A slice of white bread with jam, peanut butter or egg mayo for breakfast\n* Max of half or less of a full adult portion for lunch (varies depending on what/where my colleagues want to eat)\n* A packet of Resource 2.0 for tea break\n* Max of half or less of a full adult portion for dinner (usually a bowl of white rice and 2-3 small pieces of fish/meat and veggies)\n* A packet of Resource 2.0 for supper\n\nSo far, I've only been able to maintain a BMI of 16-17. I'm trying to target about 1800 calories per day to gain weight but I think I'm nowhere near there. The last blood test I had came back normal, but my bone density scan showed signs of osteopenia. Both tests were done a few years back but my diet has not changed much since then and I did the numbers and do think that I don't take enough calcium each day.\n\nSome questions I'll like to ask are:\n\n* What are some of the most nutritionally dense food I should take if I want to get the most amount of nutrition out of the smallest amount of portions of food? Bonus points if it keeps me satiated for a shorter period of time.\n* I've been looking at some calcium supplements and was thinking of getting [this](http://www.nowfoods.com/Bone-Strength-240-Capsules.htm) as I heard that MCHA/MCHC are the most absorbable forms of calcium. However, the magnesium is in the form of Magnesium Oxide, which I've also heard may cause diarrhea. Any suggestions for other more suitable supplements that won't cost an arm and a leg? (Maybe I should x-post this on r/supplements too)\n* I'm pretty much open to any other suggestions.\n\nI know that this is probably best answered by a nutritionist but the ones I've been to refused to tackle it from the 'compact and dense' nutrition standpoint because they assumed I had AN and thought that they would be abetting me in trying to eat less or fuel some unhealthy ED thoughts. I was only reclassified with ARFID after the classification became official and that was long after I stopped visiting the nutritionists. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, any input is greatly appreciated!",

Blend some ice cream, milk, protein powder, peanut butter, and whatever else you like.  This will give you a decent amount of calcium as well as calories.  Also, remember calcium doesn't build your bones, it prevents them from being reabsorbed.  Vitamin D is going to help more with rebuilding your bone and the mineralization process.  Get this by going out in the sun and consuming foods high in vitamin D.  Some other calorie/nutrient dense foods I suggest would be fried rice, mac and cheese, pb&j's, chili, etc.....all relatively easy to make and freeze in large quantities.  ",

Also if anyone wonders what my b12 symptoms are: tingling fingers and toes, anxiety, inability to focus, cramped toe causing limping, lower back bone pain [could be vitamin d tho]. \nidk guys i'm open to suggestions. went shopping for b12 rich foods and supplements, since it takes a while to recoup and i should get used to consuming it plenty. what do you think?\nsorry if i broke rules. even as i type this, i do so at a high pace caused by anxiety.

Many drugs and other compounds naturally occurring in our diet (nutraceuticals) have been postulated to act as mimetics of caloric restriction, leading to a wave of research investigating the efficacy of these compounds in preventing age-related diseases and promoting healthier, longer lifespans. Although well studied at the biochemical level, there are still many unanswered questions about how CR and CR mimetics impact genome function and structure. Here we discuss how genome function and structure are influenced by CR and potential CR mimetics, including changes in gene expression profiles and epigenetic modifications and their potential to identify the genetic fountain of youth.",

By affordable I mean cost per nutrient not per serving or calorie.\n\nBasically what is the cheapest way to supplement my rice and beans diet to avoid malnutrition?\n\nThanks!\n\n(BTW I am in the northwestern US if that makes a differrence.)\n\n(edit: spelling)",

There is a need to understand the density of these micronutrients and their bioavailability across diverse foods and the suitability of these foods to help meet requirements for populations with high burdens of micronutrient malnutrition.\n\n\nObjective: We aimed to identify the top food sources of these commonly lacking micronutrients, which are essential for optimal health, to support efforts to reduce micronutrient malnutrition among various populations globally.\n\n\nMethods: We built an aggregated global food composition database and calculated recommended nutrient intakes for five population groups with varying requirements. An approach was developed to rate foods according to their density in each and all priority micronutrients for various population groups with different nutrient requirements.\n\n\nResults: We find that the top sources of priority micronutrients are organs, small fish, dark green leafy vegetables, bivalves, crustaceans, goat, beef, eggs, milk, canned fish with bones, mutton, and lamb. Cheese, goat milk, and pork are also good sources, and to a lesser extent, yogurt, fresh fish, pulses, teff, and canned fish without bones.\n\n\nConclusions: The results provide insight into which foods to prioritize to fill common micronutrient gaps and reduce undernutrition",

A healthy diet is high in fiber, low in sodium, simple sugars, and trans fat. A healthy diet consistent of plenty of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet. \nIt is too reductionistic to think we just need to consume high volumes of top sources of priority nutrients.\n\nThis is the conclusion from a holistic approach:\nFrom this recent paper they found we should opt for more legumes, whole grains, and nuts and less red meat in order to increase life expectancy. https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003889\n\nOn estimated gains in life expectancy compared to a typical Western diet:\n\n> The largest gains would be made by eating more legumes (females: 2.2 [95% UI 1.1 to 3.4]; males: 2.5 [95% UI 1.1 to 3.9]), whole grains (females: 2.0 [95% UI 1.3 to 2.7]; males: 2.3 [95% UI 1.6 to 3.0]), and nuts (females: 1.7 [95% UI 1.5 to 2.0]; males: 2.0 [95% UI 1.7 to 2.3]), and less red meat (females: 1.6 [95% UI 1.5 to 1.8]; males: 1.9 [95% UI 1.7 to 2.1]) and processed meat (females: 1.6 [95% UI 1.5 to 1.8]; males: 1.9 [95% UI 1.7 to 2.1])\n\nBut I do not mean to discredit the paper in question. It is important to improve the health of people in low to middle-income countries. From the paper:\n\n> Discussion: Our analysis has provided ratings of inherent food sources of multiple and individual micronutrients commonly lacking in diets, especially in LMICs (low to middle income countries), for population groups with increased needs and the broader adult population\n\nDeficiency in low-income countries and very different from that of high-income countries.\n\n> Indeed, priority micronutrients are just one of many important aspects contributing to overall diet quality, and foods presenting low density in priority micronutrients may be rich in other essential and non-essential beneficial compounds and can contribute to overall energy and protein requirements.\n\n> Carefully constructed vegan diets could provide adequate amounts of all six priority micronutrients for the general population, except vitamin B12, which would need to be consumed through fortified foods or supplements. However, population groups with increased nutritional requirements, such as pregnant women and children during the complementary feeding period, following a vegan diet might also need fortification or supplementation for other micronutrients, such as iron, in addition to vitamin B12.\n\nI would like to add that all pregnant women in general are recommended to supplement folate and ofen iron too. Vegans less so with folate as their diet naturally contains more. Pregnant women should also be wary of too much vitamin A and thus be careful not to consume too much liver.\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vitamins-supplements-and-nutrition/\n\n> These ratings are most applicable for populations in LMICs suffering from widespread micronutrient deficiencies\n\nIn high-income countries there is more more prevalence of fiber deficiency, and excess amount of sodium, sugar, and trans fat.",

If you do for example push-ups or do intense training like soccer practice without getting enough nutrients for recovery, you will probably stunt your growth. I've found growth is not that influenced by genetics as most people believe. It is true that the body increases hunger after working out, but if you dont eat protein-rich foods, you will probably feel satiated before fulfilling your protein requirements. I am health conscious about my height, and I did pushups since I was fourteen or so. I'm 5'7, and my sister is also very short (4'10?), our diets didnt provide much proteins. It makes me kinda mad seeing all this content online telling kids to work out, its safe, etc, but also recommending protein powders and more protein consumption. Thats what I should have done, but dumb me didnt care about nutrition outside of what my mom cooked. This is in part a rant and also a real concern. If you have information that may help me I'd be very thankful. ",

So i would aim for at least the world average rda for your child's age.\n\nGreens are much more readily assimilated. I think that, for optimal growth,  supply an excellent diet, and plenty of exercise, a couple hours of aerobic exercise a day for growing children, proper stretching but not too much weights. \n\nRecently it was discovered that melatonin plays an important role in bone growth. So early bedtimes, no light is important for growing children. Get lots of sleep. It's also important for optimal memory and education.\n\nIf you're a teen trying to achieve ideal height, avoid drinking alcohol, which damages your digestive  micobiome, among other things,  so that you can absorb nutrients effectively.

Sometimes health is immediately impacted, sometimes it takes many months, sometimes it may even take years. Sometimes the initial effect is good or bad and then changes over time as it starts to have deeper impacts on various biological processes.\n\nThis guy has a masters in nutrition but doesn\u2019t know that how diets affect the body are cumulative and thinks that you can make a determination of *any* diet in 8 weeks?\n\nSome notes to make here about his blood markers that he seems oblivious to:\n\nHis triglycerides are lower because of one of two reasons; he was eating a lower fat (20%) and no sugar diet, or *because his bilirubin is elevated.*\n\nHis ALP and bilirubin increasing while his ALT is decreasing shows a trend towards a cholestatic pattern. Since he\u2019s an athlete who hasn\u2019t shown elevated bilirubin before, this could also be some evidence that his body is struggling to regulate oxidative stress, or that his liver is struggling to ditch the waste.\n\nOverall, really mixed signs here. Even the lower triglyceride/HDL ratio is not necessarily a good sign under these circumstances, and there are reasons to think it may be transient and potentially the result of factors which could  over time actually lead to poor lipid results or increased risk of certain cancers.\n\nIf this diet continued it may all level out over time, or it may continue trending towards a biliary issue or other potential downstream effects which may be going on here.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t a mere 8 weeks we might have known and we might have some insight into what the actual results of this diet were.

To be fair the 'misinformation' was far more based on individual ignorance partly due to the association of body building and fitness at the time.  For example, protein powder to the average mom was on the same level as steroids.  I distinctly remember when I bought my first dumbbells, my mom worried that I would get 'too big'.  For anyone here who does actively workout, you know that NO ONE accidentally wakes up 30lbs heavier.\n\nWith that being said, I have never heard of examples of exercise or weight lifting stunting growth under regular circumstances.  The only caveat being how hard one is working out or if they are indeed taking PEDs to assist muscular development.  Both can cause hormonal imbalances which can halt and hinder growth from a developmental standpoint.  An example of working out too hard can be see in modern gymnastics.  Many young woman in the olympics due to strenuous exercise from early ages don\u2019t develop the same female characteristics due to their workouts.  You can see this by way of reduced breast size, smaller hips, and broader shoulders.  Many even experience absent or missed menstrual cycles.  This is an extreme case with world class athletes.  To the average individual, exercise by way of strength training can be an amazing way to build confidence, relieve stress and anxiety and feel better about yourself.  Everything in balance and moderation.",

Even more studies show that it doesn't affect estrogen levels at all. If you feed soy to rats, they become infertile. If you feed it to humans, male fertility is not affected, and female fertility may even increase. So animal studies may not be useful, and soy seems to have different effects depending on ethnicity. \n\nIn the words of the author: \"This review of research concludes that a lack of evidence exists to suggest a correlation between soy consumption and hormone-related health concerns. Although, some studies suggest that further research may prove this wrong. The literature is still out on soy... As Dietitians using an evidence-based practice, it is important not to state opinions to clients on soy foods based on one study or one news article. A lot of fear is circulating around soy in the diet, especially among post-menopausal women and Cancer survivors. From a broad perspective, food fear is never something a Dietitian wants to encourage. All foods have a place in the diet in moderation. Soy is very rich in nutrients, and it may provide positive anti-inflammatory benefits from Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids primarily. Soy cannot be completely ruled out just yet, but it is important to connect people with the evidence that exists so far, and inform clients that research is still being done on this \"\n\n\n\nAlso, this isn't relevant to what you asked, but I thought this was an interesting perspective:\n\n\" This research picks my brain about why foods exist in the world\u2019s food shed so abundantly that cannot be consumed in their raw form, such as oil derived from rapeseeds that are toxic to humans due to containing erucic acid, as just one example. Also, I wonder what the health effects are of other genetic herbicides and fungicides in plants. This research shows that a natural fungicide found in a plant may have health impacts \u2014 what about plants genetically modified to contain fungicides and herbicides? What are the health effects of consuming those compounds? On the subject of soy, 90% of all soy grown in the United States is genetically modified to contain a genetic herbicide (1). In 2010, only 10% of soy plants in the U.S. had this herbicide component (1). Does this herbicide pose other health effects when consumed that may not have been researched yet?\"",

Like, doesn't your endocrine system naturally suffice your bodily need for estrogen, and so any excess estrogen consumed via external sources (food) is just ignored and therefore not used? Or am I failing to understand bodily functions?\n\n\\-Is this increase actually big enough to have detrimental effects? Or is it at more of a non-potent, residual level, unable to cause things like overactive estrogen receptors, stunted growth, enlarged breasts, lack of libido and so forth, especially in a healthy and active, low BF % individual?\n\n\\---\n\nThat's all.\n\nI apologize if this is a very vague and annoyingly ignorant question, but I have been unhealthily obsessing over it the past several weeks, so any semblance of clarity/rationality is appreciated.",

All milk (whether from cows, goats, humans, or porpoises) naturally contains small amounts of various hormones, including estrogen and progesterone. Because hormones like estrogen are fat-soluble, the level of hormones is higher in whole milk than in skim milk. When you drink milk, these hormones are digested by enzymes in your gut and as a result, are broken down and not absorbed in their active form. \n\nConcerning phytoestrogens- they have been shown to have both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects. This means that, while some phytoestrogens have estrogen-like effects and increase estrogen levels in your body, others block its effects and decrease estrogen levels. Put simply, phytoestrogens don't always mimic estrogen. In some tissues and in some people, they may block the action of estrogen.",

Only other things I'd recommend is upping your intake of beans and whole grains if you're looking to save more money. Given that you eat a few servings of eggs/yogurt/dairy, you needn't worry about incomplete proteins from other sources. You only need a small amount of the essentials to synthesize other AA. This is only a concern if you're full vegan. \n\nAlso, Lentils are incredibly good for your colon, dirt cheap, and very high in protein. Wheat may get a bad rep, but if you're buying whole wheat pastas/wheat bran/germ, most have ~10-12g protein and 8-9g of fiber  per 200 calories or so. Sure, vegetables may have more nutrients, but generally, the same energy value of a green is much more expensive.\n\nRegarding soy, just like with beans or grains, don't make it your sole source. Get a large variety of protein sources for AA and micronutrient reasons.",

One study on rats showed large amounts of soy increased mammary tissue and decreased prostate weight in males.  There are obviously health benefits attributed to soy, also.  \n  \nPersonally I would stay far away from soy unless it is organic.  Over 90% of soy grown in America in GM; not that there is anything inherently wrong with the modification, the problem lies with the pesticide used.  [Here is a very important comparison study between GM and organic soy.] (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814613019201)  It shows that GM soy has significant residues of Glyphosate herbicide and its metabolite AMPA.  It is also nutritionally inferior to organic.  \n  \nNow, Some people may tell you round-up herbicide is non-toxic, THEY ARE FULL OF SHIT.  While it is true the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not toxic to human cells, it is highly toxic to bacteria, such as the essential GI bacteria we have in our gut.  Also, the metabolite of glyphosate, AMPA, [is absolutely toxic] (http://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/environmental-metabolite-glyphosate-aminomethylphosphonic-acid-exhibits).  That is an in vitro study, so not as conclusive as in vivo.  Thankfully, [here is an in vivo study of an adjuvant found in round-up called POEA] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17165105), it is extremely toxic.  \n  \nSorry about the long pesticide rant, just covering my ass incase I get attacked by some biotech fanboys.  Anyways, not sure if anyone has mentioned it, but: NUTS and SEEDS.  Nuts are an amazing plant protein source.  Many nuts and seeds have a complete or nearly complete amino acid profile and amazing micronutrient content such as: hemp seed (the best, simply unmatched nutritional content), almonds, sunflower seeds, cashews and pumpkin seeds.  I'm definitely a carnivore and fairly serious weightlifter, but I still consider a variety of nuts and seeds to be the best post-workout snack.",

But recent research indicates that coffee may not be so bad after all. So which is it \u2014 good or bad? The best answer may be that for most people the health benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nRecent studies have generally found no connection between coffee and an increased risk of cancer or heart disease. In fact, most studies find an association between coffee consumption and decreased overall mortality and possibly cardiovascular mortality, although this may not be true in younger people who drink large amounts of coffee.\n\nWhy the apparent reversal in the thinking about coffee? Earlier studies didn't always take into account that known high-risk behaviors, such as smoking and physical inactivity, tended to be more common among heavy coffee drinkers at that time.\n\nStudies have shown that coffee may have health benefits, including protecting against Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes and liver disease, including liver cancer. It also appears to improve cognitive function and decrease the risk of depression.\n\nHowever, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee (boiled or espresso) has been associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels. And some studies found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart disease in people with a specific \u2014 and fairly common \u2014 genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body. So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk.\n\nAlthough coffee may have fewer risks compared with benefits, keep in mind that other beverages, such as milk and some fruit juices, contain nutrients that coffee does not. Also, adding cream and sugar to your coffee adds more fat and calories. Some coffee drinks contain more than 500 calories.",

This is presumably the reason why cream or milk are traditionally added to coffee, as the calcium present binds to the tannins and ends up negating their capacity to strip other minerals from the diet and body (particularly the teeth). That knowledge also makes me wary of \"non-dairy creamer\" or other coffee additives (even some marketed for their health, like [Silk Soymilk Creamer](http://silk.com/products/original-creamer)) which do not have significant amounts of calcium, and therefore do not fulfill this traditional role.\n\nedit: I should also add that this attribute of coffee probably lends some real credence to claims of it stunting growth.",

It is important you provide the building blocks for this development. Make sure you get plenty of proteins and oils. Meat, quinoa, eggs, nuts, buckwheat, flax, fish, corn, research some more. The intake you listed above for yesterday probably wasn't enough to offset the run. \n\nDespite popular belief, fruits are not all that nutritional. They are just water-sugar balloons. A banana is something marathon runners eat mid-race because of how easily it is digested, so they won't throw up. Tangerines = sugar water. These are not meals, they are sugar.\n\nSecond observation: Gas and distention. This is probably due to improper digestion. Either:\n\nA) There is some particular element of food that is not easily digested by your body. A common element is lactose, found in diary products. Many people stop producing lactase (what's needed to digest lactose) after a young age. This produces gas in the GI tract.\n\nB) Due to poor diet, the balance of bacteria in your GI tract has become, well, unbalanced. Bacteria are necessary in breaking down indigestible elements of foods into digestible ones which the body can then use. \n\nLastly, if you want to look good, hit the gym. Don't starve yourself.

Hydration is very important. It would be best for you to go to the hospital if you are malnourished. If you cannot do this, you need to see a dietitian IMMEDIATELY. Malnourishment is nothing to take lightly. You could have severe electrolyte imbalances (specifically potassium, phosphate, and magnesium) that need to be balanced out by a medical team. However, if your malnourishment is not that bad (which you won't know until you have medical tests run), you should eat 4 grams per kilogram of your body weight in protein and 175 calories per kilogram of  your body weight in total food. If you are an adult, it is 2 grams per kilogram of body weight in protein and 60 grams per kilogram of body weight for total calories. To figure out this, just divide your weight in pounds by 2.2 to get it into kilograms. Then multiply your weight in kilograms by the values above to figure out what you need for protein and total calories. However, do not reach these values immediately. Ease into them to prevent refeeding syndrome. Also, for your fat intake, increase your healthful fats such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from oils, vegetables, etc. \n\nSources:\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1104623-treatment\nMy own knowledge.

Mainly focusing on targeting fats and proteins. Aimed for 200 extra calories every week and a half or so. It is painful as your body adjusts. Eventually when you have slowly increased your intake to the 1000 mark, your body begins to crave what it needs to repair the malnourishment. This could mean some days you will have an unsaitiable hunger and need dense calorie foods to try and adequately supply your body. These next few weeks you may need 4000 calories just to help rebuild your body internally, let alone actually form insulating fat etc.\nI tried to enjoy the food. Make sure you have fat and protein with every meal and try to have around six times a day that you eat, as it may aid your metabolism. Go for lentils, beans, eggs, nut butters, oils, full fat greek yogurt in the beginning. Work from there, grains like quinoa can give added protein. Avacado is your friend as well.

They typically burn around 2200 calories per day through moderate exercise, but are crash dieting and eating around 700 calories/day. \n\nMy question regarding these two situations is this:\n\nWill both Persons A and B have a similar reaction within their bodies and their metabolism to the same deficit, regardless of the amount they eat and the means of burning those calories? I.e. will they both suffer slowed/damaged metabolisms in the long run, stunted weight loss, and eventual starvation mode? I've heard contradicting opinions on this situation, and would like some clarity just to serve my own curiosity. Thanks!",

It's meant to leave you hungry, so you keep buying and overeat.  If a company's goal is to sell food, then satiety is the opposite of their goal.  \n\nHunger is caused by ghrelin, the \"hunger hormone\" in your body.  Leptin counters this and is the \"satiety hormone.\"  The easiest way to trigger more ghrelin is to engineer food to have low fiber (for fast/easy digestion), full of added sugars, and greasy/fried (plus a host of other tweaks, like mouthfeel) to add pleasure and addictiveness.  Whole food is usually the opposite - lots of fiber to make the body work for the calories and digest slowly, no added sugars, etc.  That will release the leptin that makes you feel full.\n\nOur bodies are designed for famine.  Hunter-gatherer style.  We instinctively want to eat the foods with the highest calorie payload and we're rewarded for doing so.  Our bodies basically think \"OK, lots of energy coming in, let's eat it ALL and store it as fat for hard times ahead.\"  But the hard times never come - just a deluge of more junk food - and the whole system goes whack.",

This is typically driven by 1) social \u2014 ie: parties, celebrations and 2) emotional - boredom, anger, stress, sadness. \n\nHow to tell if it\u2019s physical vs. emotional hunger? \n\nAsk your body not what do I need to eat but rather, *what do I need?* \n\nPause and reflect on this for a few minutes before taking action. \n\nWith true hunger, any satiating type of food will typically come to mind first. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that what you need is not food but rather something else, for example: \n\n- a walk or physical activity \n- a glass of water \n- talk to someone \n- some form of entertainment or distraction \n- sleep \n- a good cry \n- something relaxing \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to confuse lack of energy, sleepiness, and thirst with hunger. \n\nEmotional hunger is also your body\u2019s way of telling you to find something soothing. \n\nIf you tend to wait until you\u2019re hangry to eat, your body may be telling you the satisfying meal is not enough and you\u2019re emotions are still high after eating the meal. You may feel like you\u2019re still hungry but it\u2019s actually you\u2019re still angry. As such, the proper thing to do would be to not wait until a point of hangry to eat. Keep healthy snacks in your work bag/work station and available at home. \n\nWe\u2019re also living in times where there\u2019s hyper palatable food around us 24/7. So it\u2019s not a surprise people turn to food to deal with emotional cravings. A diet full of poor nutrient foods could also lead to hunger. \n\nThe key is to take a moment to discern what it is you really need. Stepping outside of the emotion of you will, and mindfully examining what\u2019s behind it.\n\nThere is also hormonal causes - imbalance in ghrelin and leptin (hunger, fullness) that drive a pattern of more food cravings than usual.

I\u2019d indulge myself constantly, because, salt is just salt, right? No calories in salt. LoloOLOloLoLoL\n\nAnyway, when I got pregnant I quickly learned that I did NOT benefit from the salty foods I was eating, in fact, my body would hold onto even MORE water (edema) to try and balance out the salt I\u2019d consumed. It was so uncomfortable.\n\nAnd what\u2019s more; it\u2019s not a reasonable justification to say \u201csalt is just salt\u201d, as I had for so many years, because I certainly wasn\u2019t eating straight NaCl and going about my day. No! I was air frying packaged tater tots. I was microwaving breakfast sausages and grilling hot dogs. And all this led me to learn that I wasn\u2019t hungry for these things. They were a comfort to me, a craving I\u2019d misinterpret for actual hunger cues. Salt and sugar are zingers to your taste buds, and your palate (and brain) gets used to them as a quick fix- especially sugar for the glycogen hit. The more you indulge, the more \u201cused to it\u201d your palate becomes, and you add more, and more, and MORE!\n\nThis is where your \u201chunger\u201d for a second meal comes in. The body doesn\u2019t pragmatically plan its hunger cues. In fact, given the chance, I think the human body is geared more toward overindulgence and extra fat storage than anything else. It\u2019s like a cave man mentality- gotta store it up for winter! Or the next famine! Or whatever, you get it. But the problem is, in our modern world, many of us aren\u2019t gearing up for the next famine, though we look well prepared for it. \n\nBest practice is to eat well-balanced meals that are adequate for your activity level. If you\u2019re still feeling \u201chunger\u201d after finishing, drink a glass of water and wait 10 minutes before your next move. You may find the urge to pass, maybe it was just a craving for something sweet because\u2026 sugar. In any case, after the 10 or so minutes are up, if you still feel legitimate hunger, then go for it. Those 10 minutes can tell you a lot about what your brain and body are saying.",

Also the best time to eat a sweet is right after a meal because you will metabolize less sugar - I looked this up recently because I wondered.  I thought maybe time of day like morning is better or something but turns out it\u2019s time of meal.\n\nAnd me personally, sometimes I crave vegetables.  When I make my own food I incorporate a LOT of vegetables and a pretty wide variety but if I\u2019ve been eating restaurant food more, I get way less vegetables and I start to feel actual cravings. \n\nRefined sugar and carbs can get addicting.  Sugar produces dopamine.  I am not sure what the salt craving is all about - potentially electrolyte issue?  If you drink too much water you can get an electrolyte imbalance",

In contrast, a 1000-calorie meal consisting of whole grains, lean proteins, and complex carbohydrates like sweet potatoes will take longer to digest and absorb. Proteins and fibers extend the feeling of fullness, delay gastric emptying, and stabilize blood glucose levels, which help keep hunger at bay for a longer period.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s not just the amount of food you eat that influences your hunger but the nutritional quality and composition of those foods.",

                    "comment_text": "The number of calories you eat at one time itself isn't super relevant to hunger response.\n\nYour stomach secretes ghrelin when it doesn't contain food. Your fat cells secrete leptin when they are filling up with calories. Ghrelin triggers your brain to feel hunger (amoung other psychological factors) and leptin cancels this out. When you eat things that take longer to digest your fat cells spend longer filling up so they spend longer secreting leptin which suppresses ghrelin for longer.\n\nYour stomach will empty in 30-60 minutes (but can be delayed by eating soluble fiber, delays emptying) so ghrelin starts up pretty quickly. This is also why its good to eat a mix of calorie duration's, if you are too complex you can have a gap between stomach emptying and absorption which makes you hungry (oatmeal is very good at doing this, adding a better source of fat is helpful). Your stomach is also really easy to trick and being full of 10 calories is the same as being full of 10000 calories, its purely food volume. \n\nAdded sugar is particularly bad here because insulin speeds up how quickly calories reach your fat cells so a large spike will shorten how long leptin is secreted for.\n\nThe magic injections everyone is using to loose weight (GLP-1 agonists) short circuit the receptors that ghrelin attaches to that trigger hunger hunger response. You can save yourself a few hundred a month by just eating more protein & fiber to do the same thing. If you also stop eating when you stop feeling hungry rather than feeling full that is also helpful, core principal of mindful eating that is super effective at weight management.\n\nHunger meaning eat right now is also very much a learned response. As we respond to it with something that makes dopamine happen we condition ourselves to eat as soon as we are hungry and for hunger to be an uncomfortable sensation. You can absolutely unlearn that. Certainly don't starve yourself but nothing bad is going to happen being hungry for a few hours until your next meal.",

By 2017 it had been marketed to over 70,000 farmers, mostly in Maharashtra state where many people rely on pearl millet. Tens of thousands of Indian children are now eating this iron-rich pearl millet.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"The results have been \u201cfantastic\u201d, says Pfeiffer. \u201cThe iron improved the iron status and the physical and cognitive performance of adolescents,\u201d he says. The popularity of the Dhanashakti pearl millet could ensure that thousands of children grow up with healthy bodies and brains, with a better chance of reaching their full potential.\"  \n\n\nThe way this page is laid out, you could think the article is over and stop scrolling, but there's more.   \n\n\n(Full disclosure:  I am generally an advocate of genetic engineering of crop foods and won't hesitate to eat them.  The way the companies in the U.S. aggressively defend their IP rights isn't good, of course.  Crops like corn that are pollinated by the wind don't care about IP rights, they just throw their genes out there and hope they reach more corn, whether it's a heritage species some farmer has in a truck patch, or fields already planted by the GMO.

Foods with a low glycemic index make you feel full for longer. This is partially related to the fibre content of your food. More fibre typically also means that you'll feel hungry less fast.\n\nThirst is easily confused with hunger. Make sure you are hydrated.\n\nLack of sleep has been shown to increase hunger. Get enough sleep.\n\nI think exercise also has a positive effect on your hunger (given you don't immediately binge afterwards).

Pain, discomfort, and noises are symptoms of other problems such as ulcers or indigestion, but not caused by emptiness.\n\nIn fact our stomach \"complains\" when overly full, overstretched. Then we confuse \"full\" with \"satisfied\". From there it is easy to misinterpret any lapse in fullness with the opportunity to continue stuffing more food in before the previous food has been digested. So any gastric juices that the body produced in attempt to digest the previous food has now been diluted with new material, so the digestive process is interrupted and restarted, an obvious inefficiency.\n\nPavlov showed that dogs will salivate just for a bell... a huge part of what we call hunger is psychological.\n\nOf course there needs to be a LOT more scientific research on these fundamental principles, which are hard to do in such a way that pleases everyone because  there are variables that are hard to measure and then creating a placebo control is sometimes a riddle. \n\nFor me personally, anytime someone asks me if I am hungry, the answer is no, since I do not know what hunger feels like.

The homeostatic pathway controls energy balance by increasing the motivation to eat following depletion of energy stores. In contrast, hedonic or reward-based regulation can override the homeostatic pathway during periods of relative energy abundance by increasing the desire to consume foods that are highly palatable.\n\nSo we eat to get calories/nutrients (duh) but we also have a redundant system in which activation of our reward centers in our brains also drives intake.  I.e. we are motivated to eat both due to needing energy and because food tastes good.  This sort of redundancy is pretty common, e.g. with procreation there is an obvious biological imperative to pass on our genes, but the act in which we do so also feels good, helping reinforce the behavior.\n\nThe nutshell problem with our modern food environment is an over-dependence on hyperpalatable foods which trigger these reward pathways and induce hunger that's disproportionate to our actual energy/nutrient needs.  So would \"tricking\" the body getting calories in some sort of hypopalatable form like pills work?  Sure, it might, and there are actually a bunch of experiments like this that include weird, bland tasting liquid meals people eat and such that all seem to drive down hunger.\n\nFor a lot of people I'd go so far as to call this impractical as food isn't just \"what we eat for energy,\" it's also a social bonding experience etc.  I think a more middle path of getting *most* of your calories from comparatively whole foods, which are by their nature hypopalatable relative to modern refined junk, probably has the best chance of success.  I think the \"most\" qualifier is important because telling people \"you can never eat your favorite foods again\" is a great way to get them to not stick with your diet in the long-term.\n\nSo yah, \"tricking\" your body can work in experimental conditions like this, but in the real world, simply shifting your food supply to whole foods will largely accomplish this while preserving the aspects of food consumption that aren't purely homeostatic.  It's okay to enjoy food, have it be part of social experiences etc.",

Eating 1000 calories per day of mostly green vegetables and mushrooms, with a little bit of sweet potato, nuts and seeds - the apparent content of these capsules - would probably fill a person up as well. \n\nFurther, the premise of this is based on the fact that people lose weight when their sense of taste is diminished - which medically is normally viewed as a *bad* thing. I work with people almost daily who have poor appetites/loss of taste due to aging or occasionally medications. It would be rare to find someone who views this positively; it has a significant negative impact on quality of life and people generally miss being able to eat \"normally.\"\n\nI don't really view this type of \"diet\" as any more revolutionary than Soylent (which I never viewed as particularly revolutionary in the first place...).

If you eat at a deficit over time, lipogenesis doesn't matter, because even if you intermittent fast and have a brief window of fat accumulation, the remainder of the day makes up for it.\n\n2. If you are trying to gain muscle exercise attenuates your body to pull amino acids for muscle repair and growth. By eating 20 grams of protein every 4-6 hours you are not risking anabolic nitrogen balances. Now the jury is still out on this...no one has definitively demonstrated that nitrogen balance is the most effective way to accumulate muscle. \n\n",

However insulin can also increase the amount of calories diverted to fat storage and limiting their utilization for energy.\n\nType 1 diabetics who lose insulin production lose a huge amount of body fat regardless of caloric intake. Bodybuilders who inject insulin for muscle gain also experience larger body fat increase, especially in the abdominal area.\n\nStandard diets that are high in refined carbohydrates and processed fat cause hyperinsulinemia and are worse for health and fat gain than either low carb or low fat diets. If you check enough studies on various diets and macronutrient ratios you start to notice a pattern: Insulin levels, fat gain, and blood lipids are worse in the 40-60% carbohydrate range than either the <30% or the >70% range.\n\nInsulin and glucagon *do* significantly affect fat gain and health, but they are far from the only factors. As you said, caloric intake also matters a lot.\n\nDe novo lipogenesis is not rare at all, it is simply confused with hepatic triglyceride synthesis. DNL is a very significant contributor to worsening blood lipids, and is a key player in diabetes. You can check diabetes research on mice who have mutations in fatty acid desaturase and elongase enzymes. Or even in humans where serum saturated fat and palmitoleic acid increases the more carbohydrates you eat.\n",

However, that has much less to do with hunger than what, when, and how much you ate. You can burn fat without being hungry, and you can be hungry while still having energy left from your food. Hunger is more about reminding you when you ate yesterday (expecting you to eat again then today), your blood sugar being low (which happens about three hours after you last ate, especially if you have foods with added sugar and/or processed carbs), and the time of day (as we're generally less hungry in the mornings than later in the day).",

So my question is this:\n\n**If you are taking in less energy than you are burning, will you constantly feel at least a little hungry while you're losing weight?**\n\nI have heard some people say yes - losing weight will involve hunger.  Others have said no - and that constantly feeling hungry can paradoxically lead to weight *gain (*I assume because resisting fatty foods is harder when you're always hungry)\n\nSo if you don't feel hungry when you're losing weight, how do you know if you're actually in a calorie deficit?

Bear with me...\n\nThe body is wanting to maintain a reasonable metabolic level. If you reduce the amount you eat, there are a few things your body can do:\n\n1. Burn body fat instead \n2. Burn body lean mass instead\n3. Reduce basal metabolism\n4. Reduce voluntary activity by making us tired\n5. Bump up hunger to try to get you to eat more\n\nIn general, we are hoping that it will do all #1 and none of the others. But the degree to which #1 will happen depends on the person's metabolic health, if they are insulin resistant and hyperinsulinemic, they will find it harder to burn fat and therefore the other 4 will show up to some degree; many people who diet are used to being cold/tired/cranky, and lean body mass loss shows up in many diet trials. \n\nComplicating all of this is leptin resistance; with a healthy metabolism the brain is sensitive to the amount of leptin produced by fat cells and uses that as a long-term weight control, but leptin resistance keeps this signal getting through so the leptin does not reduce the appetite the way we would expect it to, and therefore people will very hefty amounts of body fat can still feel hungry when they reduce what they eat.\n\nThis is complicated by daily patterns of hunger and weird physiological behavior - for example, if you eat half of a breakfast you will likely be more hungry at lunch than if you eat no breakfast at all. \n\nI personally think that the calorie deficit/CICO perspective has it backwards. If you eat in ways that allow you to effectively utilized your stored body fat for energy, then you will end up with a calorie deficit and lose weight. Not the opposite.",

It seems to mesh pretty well with my understanding of how the brain regulates hunger (which I mostly got from the book \"The Hungry Brain\" by Stephen Guyenet; highly recommended).\n\nThe TLDR is that normally being overweight should increase circulating levels of leptin, a satiety hormone, and cause decreased hunger (thereby naturally fixing our weight problem). Unfortunately our brains tend to ignore leptin and its appetite suppression effect in the presence of hyper-palatable food such as ice cream, pizza, fast food, etc. Our brain's natural weight regulation system works much better when we stick to less processed foods that have been around for a long time like lean meats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.\n\nKeep in mind that this system does not dispute the CICO model. Limiting processed foods just tends to make people end the day at a lower caloric intake than they otherwise would, and tends to limit hunger even at this lower caloric intake.\n\nOne more thing that can affect hunger that wasn't touched upon in the Precision Nutrition article is sleep. Studies have consistently shown that as the amount of sleep someone gets decreases, hunger, and consequently calorie intake, increase.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3669080/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3763921/\n\nThis appetite increasing effect of sleep deprivation also seems to increase our desire for calorie dense junk food specifically (see the section titled \"Behavioral changes in food desire under sleep deprivation\" in the second paper linked above).\n\nSo to actually answer your question, restricting calories while consuming hyper-palatable foods and not getting enough sleep, while it will in theory lead to weight loss, is likely to cause persistent hunger. By contrast, many people anecdotally report losing weight effortlessly, and without hunger, when they get enough sleep and eat healthy. This also seems to happen across fairly different diets (e.g. whole food plant based and ketogenic diets), as long as the diet in question severely limits modern processed food.",

You don't necessarily need to feel hunger while on a calorie deficit diet, but most things that are low calorie are pretty meh on its own, you could eat 1kg of raw veggies and be the really full, or eat a burger with lots of fried stuff and feel hungry later, although both could have the same calorie amount.",

Conversely, there are some people who go to huge efforts to diet to gain or lose weight and then end up going back to where they started. \n\nSome people also report signficant increases in hunger and appetite when in even a slight calorie deficit, and a strong fullness response when overeating.\n\nBut I've never seen any real scientific evidence about this.

I'm just a nerd who reads stuff.\n\nThis is known as set point theory and it has been a subject of debate for decades. The short answer is it has never been proven to be true, but it continues to be discussed and researched because proving anything in nutrition is really hard if not impossible in this case.\n\nThe easiest evidence against it is looking at the population level rise in obesity over the last few decades. A theory where our body's natural set point is the dominant factor controlling our weight struggles to explain that trend. The modern version of the theory (dual intervention) theorizes that our body allows some fluctuation between some set of bounds without much fuss, but it will fight back if our energy balance gets too out of whack for too long. It's also theorized that our body fights back harder when we're losing weight than when we're gaining weight for hopefully obvious reasons.\n\nAgain, this hasn't been proven in trials and the specific biological mechanisms are not well understood.\n\nThe easiest evidence that there might be some truth to it is to take the strict calories-in calories-out model to its logical extreme. Under this theory, a mere 20 calorie per day surplus would make anybody obese over the course of their lives. Nobody can track their eating with that much precision, so clearly our body is doing *something* to regulate our weight beyond what we can control consciously. This makes sense because ancient humans had much more sporadic food intake than we do and it would be advantageous for our body to be able to maintain a roughly stable weight despite varying food intake.\n\nThe broad strokes of set point theory are widely seen by scientists as likely true, so I don't know why so many people in this thread are trying to tell you that it's bunk.\n\nHere are some articles if you want to start a deeper dive into the science:\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000629\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6039924/",

            "text": "Has anyone successfully reduced body fat % to 15% or lower? What worked for you?\n\nHere is what chatgpt suggested \n\nTo reduce body fat from 20% to 15%, a balanced approach of diet, exercise, and lifestyle adjustments is effective. Here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to help you reach that goal:\n\n1. Nutrition Strategy\n\n\t\u2022\tCaloric Deficit: Aim for a small calorie deficit (10-20% below your maintenance level) to promote fat loss while preserving muscle.\n\t\u2022\tProtein Intake: Prioritize protein (1.0-1.2 grams per pound of body weight) to maintain muscle mass, support metabolism, and improve satiety.\n\t\u2022\tBalance Carbs and Fats: Include complex carbs (like whole grains, vegetables, and legumes) for energy, and healthy fats (from sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil) for hormone support.\n\t\u2022\tReduce Processed Foods: Minimize sugar, refined carbs, and high-calorie processed foods. These can increase hunger and hinder fat loss progress.\n\t\u2022\tHydration: Drink plenty of water to aid digestion, metabolism, and exercise performance.\n\n2. Exercise Plan\n\n\t\u2022\tStrength Training: Focus on compound movements (like squats, deadlifts, and presses) 3-4 times a week to maintain muscle mass, which helps boost metabolism.\n\t\u2022\tCardio: Add 2-3 cardio sessions per week (e.g., HIIT or moderate steady-state cardio) to increase calorie burn and enhance fat loss.\n\t\u2022\tActive Recovery: Engage in light physical activity (like walking, stretching, or yoga) on rest days to support recovery without intense exertion.\n\n3. Lifestyle Factors\n\n\t\u2022\tSleep: Aim for 7-8 hours per night to improve recovery, reduce stress hormones, and support metabolism.\n\t\u2022\tStress Management: High stress increases cortisol, which can lead to fat storage. Practice relaxation techniques (e.g., meditation, deep breathing, or journaling).\n\t\u2022\tTrack Progress: Monitor body composition changes every 2-4 weeks through methods like photos, measurements, or body fat analysis to stay motivated and make adjustments.\n\n4. Consistency and Patience\n\n\t\u2022\tAim for gradual fat loss (about 0.5-1% of body weight per week). This ensures you\u2019re losing mostly fat, not muscle, and it\u2019s more sustainable over time.\n\nCombining these approaches will create a sustainable plan to drop from 20% to 15% body fat. Consistency, patience, and periodic adjustments based on your progress are key to seeing results.",

Your body is used to a specific eating schedule, and youve missed it, so your body is like, \"wtf, im hungry! I usually get food about now, and you havent given me any! Wtf! Seriously!?\"\n\n\n*Or* its you actually missing out on energy levels. You simply havent eaten enough to maintain your current energy expenditure. \n\n\nOnce again, this is all straight out of my ass, but at least it sounds plausible right?",

There's some research into possible mechanisms of leptin resistance ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2967652/), [2](https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/diabetes/53/5/1253.full.pdf)) but no real consensus.\n\nThe second paper seems somewhat plausible; if leptic resistance is related to triglyceride levels, that would make some mechanistic sense as triglyceride levels for people on the SAD are quite elevated. \n\nI think that there is something about keto that is getting rid of the leptin resistance and that is significantly affecting hunger.",

I eat a tiny calorie lunch, then have dinner with my family when my husband gets home, normally around 5 and again a small calorie count. Then once my DD is in bed and i wont get pestered to share (she is allergic to a few common ingredients) I have supper with my remaining calories, normally around 8. I use a calorie calculator to see what i have burnt today and what i can aford to eat and then remove 200 calories for discrepency.\n\nThe main thing with calorie counting is to be super strict and honest with yourself (was that sauce really only 1tbsp or was it three). Make it a habit and it wont take long to get used to it. \n\nThe big thing is to keep up your morale for the fight. If that means giving yourself food to look forward to later in the day then so be it.\n\nAlso if you are going to eat 1500 calories in low calorie foods you will seriously struggle to eat that much.

From afar it's impossible to judge what makes you feel less hungry. Let's assume what you say holds true in any case and we can establish best guesses as to what causes your symptoms, which things to look at and how to deal with them within your listed limits.\n\nFirst, congratulations to your decision. That is what it takes to make change. Use the momentum and change. Some like it radically, other's step by step. Do what makes you comfortable, as it should prevail in the long run.\n\nIf keto is not for you, and you eat veggies, fruits etc., look into a whole food plant-based diet. Plenty of sites, articles, videos etc. around that way to enjoy food. You could even combine it with keto later on if desired, but it's not a must at all. Both ways make you lose weight and as it seems, both somehow seem to be healthy. Most likely the combination of both could be the optimum.\n\nAnyhow, [this](https://www.dietdoctor.com/intermittent-fasting/time-restricted-eating) and [that](https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/fasting-physiology-part-ii/) on intermittent fasting might be interesting to you. You don't have to eat at all times. The right time to eat depends on your ultimate goal but for an average Joe it's when you feel hungry. A fast might be the quickest way to get your homones back to normal. The easiest way is not to eat at all till you are hungry starting now.\n\nBored as in watching TV and nothing to do? Well, maybe it's the programme that is boring in the first place. What interestes you? Do stuff you love, enjoy or that helps / has a meaning to you. And have some self-discipline. Everbody has ups and downs but unless you claim full responsibility for yourself, nobody is going to help with those snacks. And try not to snack food that will make you hungry sooner, which leads to try not to snack at all. Meals, whole meals, the fewer the better in general but that is personal preference if you don't compete for the world-record in lifespan.\n\n> So, I never feel hungry nor contented. But I do feel uncomfortably full after most meals (I force myself to finish my plate systematically).\n\nTake your time when eating. Chew thoroughly. Don't do anything else. Best prepare your food yourself, smell it, eat it slowly, try to taste everything you put into it. Again, chew, chew, chew. Satiety needs some time to be signaled to the brain and back to the hormones and you don't want to stuff yourself before that happens.\n\nAlso, check your ingredients. It sounds like empty calories. Drop those.\n\nYou shouldn't go on a diet mode. You should go on a lifestyle mode, which requires tons of awareness, some spoons of knowledge with a tablespoon of self-discipline.\n\nIf you want more information, post more information about your balanced diet. Tons of people out here have a lot of knowledge to share and help you out. GL",

One issue is that the lower your calorie goal (the larger your calorie deficit), the more muscle mass you will lose while you are losing weight.  Another problem that's worth mentioning is Adaptive Thermogenesis.  Basically what that is, is your body's ability to adapt to a new calorie intake and make it your new maintenance calories.  So say your body currently burns 1800 calories a day, if you eat 1800 calories every day, you will maintain your weight.  If you eat 1200 calories a day instead, two things will happen.  One you will lose weight obviously, and two, your body will start lowering the amount of calories it burns every day to adapt to the 1200 calorie intake.  Granted this takes months and months to happen, but slowly but surely it does.  That brings up new problems down the line.  \n\n> I know not getting enough sleep is stressful for your body and has long-term ramifications. Even if someone can still function on little sleep, it is not healthy.\n\nNo, being hungry and not getting enough sleep are not even on the same level.  Being hungry is honestly harmless, it's just a signal that you should eat, that's all.  Not getting enough sleep is a big problem.\n\n> As always, data trumps anecdotes, so if you know of any germane studies, please post them.

The biggest concern is making sure you are getting enough nutrients in your diet while on your restriction. Incorporating lots of vegetables and fruits and whole grains will be of benefit to you and help you feel full longer. (Also don't shy away from carbs, and if you would like the physiology behind it I'd be happy to share.)\n\nAs far as stress to your body goes, as long as you are eating in regular intervals there should not be any big problems of concern, granted you are eating a well balanced diet.  However if you tend to fast for periods and do not eat enough the main concern of a low calorie diet is ketones.  Ketones are acidic products produced when fatty acids are broken down to regulate your blood sugar levels. This only occurs when your glycogen stores are used up (carbs are stored as glycogen which is normally used to regular blood sugar levels).  When too many ketones are produced it can result in ketosis and in severe cases, will cause your blood ph to drop which is very hard on the body. \n\nSo hunger does put stress on your body, but for the diet you are describing and if it is well-balanced there should not be any problems.  However I don't recommend this goal long-term and if you are feeling sluggish or have low energy, consider increasing your calories by a couple hundred, you will still be running a calorie deficit. \n\nSource: currently working on my B.Sc.

I'm talking about.... maybe hungers where you're hungry but can wait, or hungers that are more urgent and harder to put off, things like that.

My next question would be, was the cheese low fat and why did you only use egg whites instead of the whole egg? \n\nThe reason I ask this is because depending on what else you put in your shake, the protein at least will help to keep you satiated. I don't know for sure why you were hungry within 2 hours after the breakfast meal yesterday BUT my theory is the English muffin might have had something to do with it. Breads and grains in general have a tendency to break down into glucose rapidly, this spikes your blood sugar and your body has to act fast to remove the sugar from your blood stream which could end up making you more hungry very soon after you eat it. Although, the chicken, egg whites, and cheese would have helped satiate you better than the muffin. Something to think about, and everybody is different. To help maintain satiety emphasize quality proteins and healthy fats in your diet and you'll notice a big change in frequency of hunger and cravings.",

Since hunger is the body's natural response to a caloric deficit, feeling hungry means that you've successfully achieved negative net calories, and the fat is on its way out. Any time you feel hungry, you should congratulate yourself on a job well done.\n\nTo answer more directly, pay attention to calories per volume of food at supper, and try to keep the ratio low. Eating different types of foods makes you feel more full too. Here's an article on [fullness factor](http://nutritiondata.self.com/topics/fullness-factor) that explains in more detail.\n\nDrinking water frequently can also help distinguish the difference between being hungry, and your stomach not being full, if that's an issue.\n\nThe last thing is to just give it time. The more weight you lose, the fewer calories you need, and the better your body will adapt to not having them. Exercise will also start to burn fewer calories for the same duration and intensity, and eventually fewer calories for a greater intensity than where you started. \n\nGood luck losing weight.

If you are trying to gain or lose weight, it is worthwhile to use your total calorie intake as a rough guide to where you're at, however, you'll need to track it over time and compare it to your actual weight, and change your target to accommodate the consistent bias that \\*your\\* body and \\*your\\* diet and \\*your\\* pattern of choices introduces. \n\nthe total calories listed are consistently 20-25% above and below the real food, but if you're eating a normal mix of food, it will generally average out pretty ok. The larger problem is, as i said above, the bias from your body/habits/specific diet. There are genetic differences that cause some people to burn a lot more calories \"at rest\" through a process called NEAT, while others are much more efficient at actually sitting around when they sit around. \n\nYour total energy balance is also going to be heavily impacted by your activity and exercise (which also influences your appetite and ability to stick to a diet, as do your choices about \\*what\\* to eat). It is much, much harder to get accurate estimates of calories from exercise and activity than it is from food - given all the variation in calories on nutrition labels, it is still a million times more accurate than calories from exercise and basic activity.   \n\n\ngood luck! but, it does all mostly come down to whether you keep at it and learn how to use the information to make small, incremental changes over time that build up to your overall goals.

In a pan just cook some bacon strips and then use the bacon fat to cook 2-3 eggs that always end up scrambled cause aint nobody got time for omelette and just add any veggies lying around (takes me 10mins max). I sometimes grill some sausages the night before for breakfast. \nAaand leftovers, I know it might sound crazy but when I'm too lazy to cook or prep a breakfast I'll have for breakfast any leftovers from the previous day. \nFor lunch, the easiest way to go is making a tortilla chicken sandwich that you can put anything you fancy in it, or eggs or whatever you have. I really like salmon because it only takes 20-25mins in the oven, so you can make it the day before with some rice and veggies.\nAs for snacks your typical nuts, yoghurts, health bars and fruits.",

            "text": "Hello all, I was wondering if anyone has had any experiences with fasting, either voluntarily or involuntarily, and hunger pains or urges. What has been happening recently to me is that sometimes I can go 12+ hours without eating now, either because I am at my job and I can;t (I work as a specialist in the surgical setting, some times I just can;t get away to snag a bite to eat, especially if the case goes long or the surgeon stacks them one after another all day), or sometimes i just don;t feel like eating. It has happened that I have eaten at 6pm the nigh before, gone to sleep, woke up, didn;t feel hungry at all and just went without food until lunch. I don;t eat excessively, or at least as excessively as I used to when I was younger, and my portion sizes are standard if not smaller than recommended when i do eat.\n\nThe weird thing is that this has not been my experience here at all. I used to get really bad stomach pains when i didn't eat anything at least every 4 hours, and this easy fasting has been happening pretty regularly for the past 6 months or so. My weight has stayed about the same here, no real change at all, a little up during the holidaze then down again when i went back to working out, but no major weight gain or loss. \n\nI was wondering if this means my metabolism is slowing down a bit, as I did turn 30 a few months ago and have heard there is a noticeable slowdown around that time. I just thought that it would take a bit longer since I was a HS and college athlete, took pretty good care of myself and even lost a lot of weight from 22-24 to stave off future problems with blood pressure and cholesterol and such. I was just wondering if anyone on here has started to experience this and what they have done about it, if its a bad thing or not?",

That's how it feels to me, but I am wondering if this is all placebo/confirmation bias or not. Is there some research, or are there other people here with the same experiences?\n\nCheers\n",

I've always had some GERD-style whatnot since I was very young - and it gives me the nauseous/burping/etc. feeling you describe if I don't give it time to settle.  Also makes eating food too quickly after I get up rather uncomfortable.\n\nIf I'm doing a long ride then I'll make sure I eat something slow-burn (like oatmeal), wait a couple hours - then pop Gu's every 30-45 mins to make sure I don't bonk (I've found they're easiest on my stomach and a couple flavors that are delicious) and also keep something with extra calories in my hydration if possible.",

Hormones, muscle mass, etc.\n\nBut barring some medical side effect or medical issue, that's a SMALL factor.\n\nWhen you see someone and think \"they can eat anything and not gain weight\" you are almost certainly wrong.  It's because you see only a small part of their life.  They might wake up, eat literally nothing for breakfast, and go for a run.  Then the go into work, and you see them wolf down that double cheeseburger and fries and have a candybar with it.  Then they go home, walk their dog for an hour, and skip dinner.\n\nAll you saw was the one big, unhealthy meal.  You didn't see that they  might be *under*eating, and that they exercise twice a day and eat nothing outside of that meal.\n\nOr on the flip side, your coworker that bemoans the fact that they only eat a \"salad\" but still gains weight.  They might wake up and have a \"muffin and a latte\" for breakfast, but it's a MASSIVE sugar muffin and some kind of caramel double whip latte.  They've eaten their calorie allotment for the day by 9am.  Then they eat that \"salad\" for lunch, but it has fried chicken cut up on it, a gallon of ranch, and bacon bits.  Then they have a full meal, and a nighttime snack, all while not moving at all all day long, and pounding down full calorie cokes.\n\nIn short... yeah, metabolism might have a LITTLE to do with things, but it's a tiny part of it.  98% of weight gain or loss is just calories in versus calories out.  That's it.  It's just that most of us see very little of the actual \"calories in, calories out\" equation for most of our friends, and are often even a bit delusional about our own calorie intake over the day, glossing over much of it in our minds.\n\nWhen I was at my thinnest as a distance runner, I used to HATE when people would say \"well, you are lucky, you can eat whatever you want and not gain weight.\"  And I'd think \"no, this is HARD WORK, and it's only because i'm running miles and miles every day.\"  There was no luck at all.",

Not all meals are equal, some are definitely more calorie dense than others even if they appear to be as filling. \n\nLet's say your maintenance level is at 2300 calories, and you try to make some efforts to lose some weight in a non-drastic way (averaging -300 to -400 calories per day). Let's see how it might pan out on a whole week :\n\n- Day 1 : 1900 calories (-400)\n\n- Day 2 : 2000 calories (-300)\n\n- Day 3 : 3000 calories (+700) (You underestimated a meal and drank two beers with your buddy)\n\n- Day 4 : 2000 calories (-300)\n\n- Day 5 : 2950 calories (+650) (Friday)\n\n- Day 6 : 2050 calories (-250) \n\n- Day 7 : 2000 calories (-300)\n\n\nIn your mind, you thought you did a good job. Overall, you had 5 successful days!\n\nThe problem is that if you combine the numbers, you end up with only a -200 negative result over the whole week, which is roughly -29 calories per day. At the end of your next week, if you end up with a +200 positive result, you've basically been at maintenance for two weeks!\n\nBeing consistent is hard, as all it takes is a single day to screw you over (same for gaining weight). That's why counting calories is so effective. If you knew at days #3 and #5 that you consumed a total of 1350 extra calories, you'd make sure to consume a greater deficit during the remaining days.\n\nBeing active, doing cardio and playing sports regularly also help, as it helps you being consistent on the negative side. If you subtract an average of 150 calories per day because of your active life, then suddenly, you end up with -1250 calories at the end of the week despise eating way too much on days #3 and #5. Not too bad!\n\n**#2 : Don't underestimate cheat days**\n\n\nSimilar to reason #1, but in a more drastic way. Let's say you have a proper diet, not counting calories, and every Friday you tell yourself \"fuck my diet for tonight, I'm gonna eat pizza and drink booze\".\n\nTo simplify things, let's assume that from days 1 to 6, you average -250 calories per day, which is a slow-ish deficit rate. That's -1500 calories over 6 days.\n\nNow, friday night. Your friends are over, you eat pizza. That meal consists of an extra 500 calories than usual. Over the night, you drink some beers, about 4 regular ones. That's about 500 calories. During the whole evening and night, you also eat some chips or other junk food for an extra 500 calories.\n\nBoom, that's an extra 1500 calories. You went from a negative -1500 calories to a maintenance level just because you ate pizza, drank 4 beers and ate some chips in the span of no more than a couple hours!\n\nThis is exactly why diets like keto work so well with most people. Keto doesn't allow you to have cheat days like this, because naturally most cheat days consist of an insane amount of carbs. (Most) people don't go on cheat days and eat 4 avocados, 1/2 lb of nuts or 2 kilos of tofu. They go on cheat days and proceed to eat junk food and beer. In other words, carbs aren't the devil, they just happen to be present in most junk-food we eat. \n\n**#3 : It's all in the small details**\n\nSmall details can make a **drastic difference** over a long period of time. When people say \"I don't eat that much and I'm fat!\" or \"I eat a lot and don't gain weight!\", they tend to forget about the small details of their daily routine.\n\nLet's take person A and person B working in an office. Both seem like they eat pretty much the same thing, but person B will definitely become fatter.\n\n- Breakfast : Person B drinks an extra glass of milk. +140 calories\n\n- Snack : Person A doesn't snack before lunch. Person B eats a small amount of nuts in his cubicle. +100 calories\n\n- Lunch : Person A uses mustard in his sandwich. Person B uses mayonnaise. +90 calories\n\n- Snack : Person A doesn't snack before dinner. Person B eats a banana in his cubicle. +90 calories\n\n- Dinner : Person A and B both eat the same meal.\n\n- Late evening : Person A doesn't eat anything. Person B eats a small portion of yogurt before going to bed. +80 calories\n\n- Throughout the day : Person A drank two black coffees. Person B drank two coffees with milk and sugar. +80 calories\n\nOverall, person B has consumed an **extra 580 calories!** And yet, both persons ate very similar meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner), and person B did eat healthy food as snacks, so as an outside perspective it's hard to imagine that person B might get much fatter than person A.\n\nAlso, small details appear within a meal :\n\n- How much oil do you use? Do you like your salads with a crapload of vinaigrette, or a small amount? Do you use a lot of mayo, or little mayo or any other low-calorie dense condiments? Do you often incorporate butter in your meals? Do you drink milk/juice, or only water? Do you add milk and sugar in your coffee? Do you pour sauces over your meat? How often do you eat desserts? Are you more of a red meat consumer, or a white meat / fish consumer? Do you put grated parmesan on all pasta dishes? Do you consume bread with your pasta dishes? Do you generally drink light beers or calorie dense craft beers such as IPAs?\n\nI could go on and on... small details can add up, *really* fast.\n\n\n**#4 : Just because it's healthy or healthier doesn't mean it won't make you fatter**\n\n\nIt's easy to assume that just because you eat healthy food, you're going to lose weight. But unless you go from a really shitty diet to a really healthy diet, it doesn't mean you're going to lose weight.\n\nA banana has nearly 100 calories. An apple has nearly 60 calories. Avocados are high in calories, as well as nuts. If you eat brown bread or pasta, it's still packed with calories, it's just healthier for you than white bread/pasta. Your \"healthy\" granola bar has probably the same amount of calories than your crappy one. etc...\n\nIncorporating healthy snacks throughout the day can be problematic if you weren't eating snacks before, for example. *\"I'm gonna start eating more fruits!\"* Simply switching to a more healthier brand won't necessarily make a difference (granola bars, chips, crackers, etc) either. Yes, healthy foods can make you feel full more easily, reducing your hunger, which can potentially make you lose weight over a long period of time... but you can't take healthy food for granted. Calories are calories, so whenever you look up a \"healthy looking\" product, look up for the label. \n\n**Heck, some people might grab a healthier brand of chips that has about 60% the amount of calories than Doritos, but they end up eating more of it!** Because they know it's technically healthier and less calorie dense, in their mind, they can eat more of it without feeling guilty. At the end of the day, you're still going to consume a crazy amount of calories. ",

If you do for example push-ups or do intense training like soccer practice without getting enough nutrients for recovery, you will probably stunt your growth. I've found growth is not that influenced by genetics as most people believe. It is true that the body increases hunger after working out, but if you dont eat protein-rich foods, you will probably feel satiated before fulfilling your protein requirements. I am health conscious about my height, and I did pushups since I was fourteen or so. I'm 5'7, and my sister is also very short (4'10?), our diets didnt provide much proteins. It makes me kinda mad seeing all this content online telling kids to work out, its safe, etc, but also recommending protein powders and more protein consumption. Thats what I should have done, but dumb me didnt care about nutrition outside of what my mom cooked. This is in part a rant and also a real concern. If you have information that may help me I'd be very thankful. ",

Get used to eating calorie dense foods and your body struggles to get enjoyment out of healthier foods\n- Blood sugar spike. More likely to spike your blood sugar which will result in you sooner feeling hunger, an overreaction to the food.\n- Empty calories.

It referenced studies where participants rated their satiety after eating certain foods, and the study tracked how many calories they ate later in the day and how long it took them to feel hungry again.\n\nSome of the scientific explanations as to why whole foods are more satiating, in an extremely oversimplified manner: higher water content and more volume per calorie, plus a higher fiber content. The stomach can empty out quickly with processed and ultraprocessed foods because there's no fiber to slow it down, but when fiber is present, it bulks up the food in your stomach which then takes longer to empty.\n\nI can say on an anecdotal level, since switching to a diet that is at least 80% whole food plant based, I have never felt better. I'm sticking to a calorie deficit more easily, feeling more satisfied, more energetic, and less bloated. Every time I added a new vegetable, legume, fruit, or source of whole grain into my daily calorie target, I crowded out junk, and it's been life changing.",

It has no fiber or protein, so foods like this basically dissolve quickly and doesnt fill you up, and your body barely has to do anything with it.  \n\nWhereas if you\u2019re eating foods higher in fat, fiber, protein; your body breaks it down.  Things like fiber will slow the absorption of sugars, protein requires energy for your body to breakdown amino acids. \n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that, a lot of the time when you eat junk food like chips, or candy, it\u2019s because you\u2019re bored.  We don\u2019t usually eat these things because we\u2019re hungry, we do it because we\u2019re bored.  There is evidence to back up the fact that if you\u2019re busy, and moving your body/walking, you are less likely to reach for these types of snacks \n\nPersonally, I kind of reject the idea that we all overeat because we aren\u2019t satiated, for that reason.  If you\u2019re eating for reasons that have nothing to do with hunger in the first place (like stress or boredom), then how does satiety solve that problem?",

Not even needed. Literally from the package to the sheet tray and in the oven.   \n- Oven roasted veggies. Any fucking veggie. Cut or not cut, doesn't matter, but you gotta wash them. Don't even need to peel. If you need salt, pepper, light olive oil. Done.   \n- Steamed veggies and salmon. Steamed salmon is delicious. Frozen, take it out of the package onto a parchment paper on a steamer. I personally love it just like this. If you insist on doing more work, fine, cut a lemon and throw it on top.   \n- Red Peppers. Just have them around. Great vitamin C and you just crunch on them as needed. I dont even cut them.   \n- Walnuts and Brazil nuts. Every day for breakfast.   \n- Kefir and yogurt. Everyday for breakfast. Throw the nuts on it. Done.  Oatmeal is too much work haha   \n- Scrambled eggs, or I like 6minute eggs, they're healthier with a runny yolk.   \n- Avocados. Just have them around. No need to smash them or make guac, just cut and eat directly from the peel. No dishes. \n\nYou do need to be ok with simple food and have easy access food, like lemons and vinegar for quick and easy dressings, and toppings like pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, hemp seeds, flax seeds.

                    "comment_text": "Sometimes, inspiration comes natural. I\u2019ll find myself craving a single ingredient and make a meal out of it. So if I\u2019m really craving mango, I\u2019ll do a Caribbean style dish like fish with mango pur\u00e9e and coconut lime rice with a pineapple citronette salad. Or jerk tacos with pineapple salsa and coconut rice. Or if I\u2019m feeling a certain kind of cuisine but lack inspiration I might look up \u201cCaribbean recipes\u201d or \u201cMexican recipes \u201c until I find something interesting. But I\u2019m a huge foodie and I love trying new things and playing with fun ingredients. One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. \n\nIf you want something with better direction, I\u2019d look into food blogs. You usually have to wade through a bunch that don\u2019t catch your fancy before you find one that suits your tastes.\n\nFor fun, adventurous recipes I really like Half Baked Harvest. It has lots of fusion foods, Asian inspired, Mexican inspired, and lots of Italian inspired. Some of my favorite recipes of hers are lasagna soup, jerk tacos, and a creamy Thai style noodle soup. But, they often call for some specialty ingredients, and sometimes lots of extras that I skip out on. But she focuses on wholesome ingredients and flavorful combinations. \n\nBudget Bytes is great for cheap, simple recipes with relatively few ingredients, with almost exclusively wholesome ingredients with lots of fruits and vegetables, and many vegetarian options. \n\nSkinny Taste is a cool blog for \u201cdiet\u201d food that doesn\u2019t taste \u201cdiet\u201d. It features \u201clightened up\u201d recipes that forgo heavy sweetening and highly process ingredients, as well as comfort foods and lean meat recipes. They have a great enchilada casserole recipe, and I love their bruschetta stuffed chicken. When I make these for my SO he has no idea that recipes came from a site called \u201cskinny taste\u201d. Some are low carb and such, but they also have plenty of balanced recipes with rice and things like that. They also have recipes for things like homemade veggie tots to sneak vegetables and healthier cooking methods into comfort foods. \n\nFrolic and Fare is a food blog that focuses on floral and herbal ingredients. It\u2019s lots of sweets, but I find a lot of inspiration in the unique ingredients. \n\nSift and Simmer is also heavy in sweets recipes, but she also has recipes for Asian style foods as well as floral ingredients. These blogs are a lot of fun if you want to explore and try new things. \n\nSpicy Southern Kitchen is really big on comfort foods from pastas to curries and home made ramen dishes. They have a wide array of cuisines and I absolutely love the Mardi Gras pasta. I make it for my SO who is from NOLA and he absolutely loves it!\n\nYou can also google \u201cbest food blogs\u201d to find some that suit your personal tastes. It\u2019s a great way to not only explore and find inspiration, but also a way to find new staples for your pantry. I find that once you have a little more experience with new ingredients it gets easier to use those ingredients intuitively in new ways, and you really find your own cooking style. \n\nMost importantly, have fun. Feel free to swap ingredients you don\u2019t like for ones you prefer, and make adjustments to recipes. I find that I always get better results when I season from the heart, and I find it to be much more enjoyable. \n\nYou might also brows your local bookstore for cookbooks. You can find entire cookbooks just for crock pot recipes, or \u201c30 minute dinners \u201c as well as specific dietary needs such as low carb, or fresh and natural ingredients. \n\nI\u2019ve also found some YouTube series on cooking that can be very helpful if you prefer video format. I personally prefer written format myself, but YouTube can be a great resource if you\u2019re not as into reading.",

Sometimes it's a reaction to how we're feeling, sometimes it's hunger.  If it's hunger, eating something with protein/fiber can be helpful, but in terms of a specific craving:  \n  \n--A nutrient dense swap can come in handy. For example if you're craving candy/sweets, opting for a sweet fruit instead like mango, watermelon, grapes or pineapple can be a good swap that satisfies that craving.  Craving a chocolate bar? Try a couple pieces of high quality dark chocolate instead.  Craving carbs? Try a more nutrient dense carb like sweet potatoes/golden potatoes. \n\n--Have the food but have a smaller portion size than you'd typically have.  Let's say you are craving fries and typically grab a large fry from a fast food spot, try a small fry instead.  Enjoy it mindfully and really savor the flavors of what you're eating.  \n\n--If your goal is to completely avoid the food because it's something that feels hard to moderate, then level up your environment at home to support you by clearing that food from the kitchen, removing it from the environment completely or put it all in one central cabinet out of sight.  Put a fruit bowl on the counter with your favorite fruits, get some of your fav protein bars and stock up on nutrient rich/high fiber snack options that will feel more satiating. \n\nIf it's not hunger and it's more due to emotions and how you're feeling:  \n  \n--A non-food related tip - get outside for some fresh air and a 5- 10 min walk.  Play a video game or do an activity you enjoy instead.  Call a friend, spend time with a pet, draw/color, turn on your favorite music and dance.  Getting a feel good boost or comfort from something other than food is helpful.  Cravings come and go, and if we can shift our energy, environment and focus, that can sometimes be enough for the craving to pass. \n\nHope these help!",

I dont know when to have what. \n\nOther more general arguments are, \n\n-During the day, particularly days we are busy with tasks, we are in more of a sympathetic mode which is not a conducive state to be in to digest large amounts of food (big meals/harder to digest foods). So avoid large meals and eat/snack light until the evening where you can shift into more of a parasympathetic mode more conducive to \u2018resting and digesting\u2019 larger meals\n\nOR\n\n-large meals in the evening negatively affect sleep and so consume larger meals earlier in the day when our digestion ton is stronger and more efficient (ie. more gastic acid secretion, better nutrient partitioning) and our insulin sensitivity is higher.

Glucose is the primary fuel source of your body, carbs are the only macro which don't have another biological function. We can make energy from fatty acids and aminos too, fatty acid pathway is very common (we also make fatty acids from carbs, that's how we store excess carbs we eat as fat) while the amino pathway is not.\n\nYou want carbs to be about half of your calories with almost all of those being complex carbs. Complex carbs are chains of glucose, it takes your gut time (1-4h) to break the glucose out of the chain so its absorbable.\n\nGetting glucose from complex carbs is great. Getting glucose from non-fruit simple carbs (added sugar) is not. Exceeding 5% of your total calories in added sugar has a negative impact on your health. Eat lots of plants. The rate at which glucose hits your liver determines if its bad or not, simple carbs are absorbed very quickly (eg sugar from soda 30-60 minutes rather than the 1-4 hour slow/sustained absorption with complex) so your liver shits the bed and makes some bad lipoproteins that gives you bad cholesterol numbers.\n\nThose who are diabetic/pre-diabetic (you would almost certainly already know if this was you) have to be careful with carbs because their bodies don't regulate glucose effectively. Everyone else can eat carbs.",

I don't think it's a sustainable diet long term or if you're trying to build muscle, but for short term use if you want to drop a ton of weight keto+ IF for ME was the best thing. It. not only satiated me the most it really made noticeable differences in how much energy I had, how alert I was, etc. The biggest downsides are you will always feel thirsty. I was drinking a gallon+ of water a day and still was dry mouth. Something about the diet fucks with your electrolytes. 2. You will feel lethargic in the gym. Once I finally got carbs and sugar back in my diet my lifts were so much better. The energy and alertness I had running or throughout the day was gone when I started lifting heavier. I say play around with both and monitor your health. If for long term dieting I think a high carb diet might be more healthier, but I think a balanced diet is the best way to go.",

            "text": "I am not a nutritionist, but my understanding is that leptin is the hormone that our bodyfat directly produces in order to manage satiety.  The more fat we have, the more leptin is produced, the less hungry we get and the more quickly we shed fat.  It\u2019s literally our body\u2019s fat control lever.\n\nThe core issue would thus seem to be how sensitive we are to the leptin our bodies produce.  The more leptin we require before we turn off the hunger switch then the more resistant we are to it and the more fat we\u2019ll have on our bodies.  This jibes directly with the controversial \u201cbodyweight set point\u201d concept and why we all yoyo when we diet.  Our leptin system ultimately wins the battle every time unless steps were taken during the diet to fix it.\n\nSo if the above is true (and again, I\u2019m not a nutritionist so my perusing through wikipedia and so forth may be leading to incorrect conclusions \u2014 there\u2019s no dogma here and I\u2019m happy to be corrected), then shouldn\u2019t our focus be on how we become more leptin sensitive?  Isn\u2019t literally every approach to longterm weight loss futile if it\u2019s a losing battle against leptin?  Why would I want to cut 30 pounds if my leptin all but guarantees that I gain it back?  It\u2019s the same reason why some people can struggle to put on 20 pounds and then show off how quickly they can lose it by eating nothing but twinkies.  Their natural leptin sensitivity makes this easy for them.\n\nObviously some fat people do keep their weight off (although this is the exception rather than the rule) it seems to me that they must have done so by inadvertently fixing their leptin sensitivity, probably by eating certain foods or eating less of certain other foods.  Calorie input over time becomes lower, but less due to conscious effort.\n\nI know there are some studies out there about how different diets and fitness routines affect leptin sensitivity, but why aren\u2019t there more such studies and why does the focus seem to rarely on this hormone that\u2019s *literally produced by our bodies to manage fat*?",

The two factors that determine leptins efficacy are;\n\n* How effectively leptin stop the amygdala responding to ghrelin. This isn't really testable as vivisection isn't a useful way of testing humans :)\n* How long leptin is released for. Most brains don't need very much leptin at all to turn off ghrelin response. You will have experienced the extremes at both ends of this before, sometimes hunger hits you like a wall and sometimes you just become hungry slowly.\n\nThis 2nd one is the one you control with diet. Leptin is produced while your fat cells are filling so controlling duration is a case of eating foods that spend a long time digesting & absorbing. Ghrelin is produced when your stomach is empty, your stomach will be empty 60-90 minutes after eating a big meal.\n\nIf you eat sugar leptin will turn on very quickly and will turn off very quickly, generally about a half an hour window between both. If you eat a steak and nothing else ghrelin will turn off initially because your stomach is full but you will have a window between ghrelin production starting again and calorie absorption because fat & protein take a long time to digest (2 hours and up to 4 hours).\n\nTo manage this you want a meal with a mix of calorie durations. Some simple carbs, some complex carbs, some fats and some proteins. You want to spread those calories out over the full 4h.\n\nYou also want to eat lots of soluble fiber. Beyond the health effects they gel in the stomach and slow everything down so you extend calorie duration even more.",

It's pretty clear that it's highly associated with insulin resistance and it may be the same thing. \n\nOn the keto diet some people see a resolution of leptin resistance quickly with their hunger being reduced significantly.

Now, there will still be health issues, and there are plenty of studies showing that an excess of saturated fat in ones diet, for example, increases intestinal permeability, atherosclerosis, and leads to health issues, but I do believe that effect would be at least somewhat mediated by the whole foods. And, in perspective, I would definitely rather people eat saturated fat from whole food sources than anything processed like cookies and potato chips.\n\nWith that being said, we have decimated our environment so much that I don't think 95% of the world's health problems will be solved with a good diet. Firstly, we have poisoned our land through excessive use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, and industrial farming practices; our environment is far too clean, and we still overuse antibiotics, so people would continue to have crazy allergies; air, light, noise pollution, and stressful lifestyles would still affect peoples' mental and physical health negatively. \n\nAnd I'm not sure which of these is the biggest factor in our ailing health.

The problem is processed foods as you mentioned which is typically carbs and meat. This is where the demonization comes from. Carbs are typically stripped down so much that they increase insulin dramatically causing spikes and insulin resistance which causes weight gain over time. \n\nMeat is similar to some degree since most is grain fed and pumped with antibiotics. It still can have the same insulin raising effects. Since we started eating processed foods in the 50s obesity and weight gain has only increased. I highly recommend the obesity code for a great read about what REALLY causes weight gain. \n\nOverall Whole Foods will be so much better for you. That\u2019s the best place to start for anyone.

The Adequate Intakes for essential fatty acids for an adult male are 1.6 g of omega 3 and 17 g for omega 6, IIRC 12 g omega 6 for a female. That's pretty low, and some agencies that quote it as a percentage of calories can end up even a bit lower.\n\nIf you didn't get the minimums, you could eventually suffer the signs and symptoms of [fatty acid deficiency](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#deficiency). I may have had a little of that this summer, but I was getting half of the AI of omega-6 for an extended period of time (months), as well as being slightly calorie restricted (which probably prevented de novo lipogenesis, causing essential fat to be burned instead of used, I would guess). You wear the fat you've been eating, so body fat will probably prevent deficiency for a while, assuming it contains omega 3 and/or 6.\n\nThat being said, you can't become as \"carb adapted\" as you can \"fat adapted\", meaning that your body will continue to burn fat. A low fat diet gives you a [slight advantage](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/cp-ldr080615.php) when it comes to weight loss. A low-fat diet composed of whole, natural foods makes it very difficult to overeat and IME is a great way to lose weight and keep it off.

            "text": "\\[Academic\\] Thanks so much to the moderator who spent the time looking through my research and allowing me to post this here, really grateful!\n\nHey all,\n\nMy research aims to investigate whether experiencing a loss of control eating is more common in people with inattentive and impulsive tendencies than the general population.\n\nIf you wouldn't mind taking around 7 mins to participate I'd be ecstatic! I genuinely care about this and have put so much work into it so I'd just love as many participants as possible as that's the best bet for showing clear results.\n\nI'm super exited for the results of this as I work in a clinic and through my interactions with patients could see how this research would help in contributing to developing our patient led services to help empower people who experience distressing eating behaviours. So I decided to choose it as the topic for my MSc thesis.\n\nLink here: [https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_exlSbWguxzFzxX0](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_exlSbWguxzFzxX0)\n\nI have a background in nutrition and that's what lead me towards eating disorders when I moved over into psychology. My literature review and discussion here are focusing on the interaction between neurotransmitters (mainly dopamine), leptin, ghrelin, and glucose on eating behaviour, so hope you find this interesting too! Really grateful to those who participate here.\n\nDemographics: everyone between the ages of 18 - 80. However, those who are currently being treated for an eating disorder or addictions should not participate. Individual responses are anonymised, making Reddit the perfect place to source participants!",

People with depression are more likely to eat junk food (confort food) than people without it. Depression alters your gut microbiota balance, this might affect your RMR, also means you'll be likely less active so that produces muscle loss (this reduce your RMR)and increases fat storage so more adipoquines such as leptin (chronic inflammation) = +hunger. Also your sleep is affected = stress hormones are increased (cortisol, noradrenaline). \nThese are only a few just to name the most important but it's much more than this. \nSo yes, depression affects your metabolism in a large scale.",

A typical boneless, skinless chicken breast is often something like ~130-170 calories, if that's what you mean by chicken.  You're describing a meal that may be only ~400 calories and asking why you're hungry, unless you've left out other foods you ate.\n\nI don't know your gender offhand, but there's a high likelihood that you'd probably need 2000+ calories a day to feel decent/satiated, particularly if you're male.  Anything under ~2400 calories per day for me is into active dieting/cutting territory, and I'm only 150 lbs (male).  Unless you're eating 5-6 of these meals a day you're going to wind up pretty hungry.\n\nThe long and short of it is you simply need to eat more.  I eat 3 larger meals a day, and a meal for me might start with what you described + some non-starchy veggies + a large handful of nuts + a shitload of fruit (e.g. large apple plus another 100 grams of grapes), putting me at something like ~800 calories per meal, or roughly twice the energy content of the meal you described.  Despite being high in \"carbs\" I find this extremely high-volume of food method of eating about as satiating as possible.",

More fiber -- a side of broccoli.  More fat -- butter on the broccoli.\n\nI know sweet potatoes are a Paleo darling and I love them, but when baked you convert all the starch to straight up simple sugars.  So rather than your body having to break down the starches it gets a spike of glucose.  And as others have said, the spike in blood sugar, followed by insulin release, will leave you feeling hungry again.\n\nThis was a study comparing dextrose (your sweet potato, if baked, was pretty much straight sugars...) to ketones.  \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29105987\n\n\"Temporally related to the observed suppression of ghrelin, reported hunger and desire to eat were also significantly suppressed 1.5 hours after consumption of KE, compared with consumption of DEXT.\"\n\nI know about this study because of my own experience with suppressed hunger when my blood ketones were high.  The point that's relevant to you is how hunger responded to dextrose, particularly Figure 2.\n\nTools to blunt the rise in BG/insulin and the rest of the hormone cascade include (again for most people, see what works for you!) fiber, protein and fat.  \n\n\n",

I used to be able to go at least a day without a meal and not even think about it. If your macros are in line, you should be adapted after a couple weeks. You mentioned that you've been following keto for more than 5 weeks, so if you're hungry all the time then something is off. You're either not eating enough, your fat intake is too low, or your carbs are high enough that you're not actually reaching or maintaining ketosis. When you're trying to troubleshoot the issue, start with the basics. Are you measuring and tracking all of your food and being honest about what you eat? Are you keeping your net carbs under 20g/day? You mentioned trying to drop a little weight, so are you eating at too large a caloric deficit? (A 10% caloric deficit should be fine unless you have a lot of weight to lose.)

Naturally slim people will have an extremely difficult time adding weight, too. \n\nI ultimately put all the weight back on after about 5 years: studying 20+ hours a week on top of working full time made maintaining routines very difficult, and, if you\u2019ve lost substantial weight, you have to manage that really high appetite *and* eat less than someone of the same weight who was never overweight.

I can eat a huge bowl of salad with low-calorie dressing, and other plant-based foods and the fiber and water content in these foods will end up keeping me full for longer. These are usually low-calorie dense foods. But if I am eating calorie-dense foods like most super-processed foods usually are, then obviously I will feel hungry even if I am eating the same number of calories. \n\nSecondly, a more complex factor would be how my body and brain are wired. There are several hormones that control your hunger or affect how your body stores fat, etc. A combination of these different and complex factors will decide how hungry you feel. If you are taking medication or have disorders that affect these hormone levels, that can mess up your hunger signals as well.",

They will not be able to make up the energy deficit on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn reality, there are often other things going on, like insulin resistance, leptin and ghrelin issues, thyroid levels and all kinds of other variations between people which can affect hunger so it's not as straight forward in real life.\n\nThe only real life comparison we can do would be the same person at different body fat levels, in which case I agree with akohhh. From 270lbs down to about 190lbs, I was rarely hungry even with a 50% caloric deficit at times. At 175lb, I am starving if I try to do more than a 20% deficit. I don't necessarily think it's a set point, it's just hitting a body fat % where you can no longer meet all the energy requirements of the caloric deficit with fat stores and you start to draw from other things like lean mass. That's something that really triggers a physiological need to eat more. So you need to have a smaller deficit at that point.",

However, I keep my diet very low carb and go back into ketosis occasionally (mostly in conjunction with fasting). I eat essentially a paleo/ancestral diet now and have no trouble maintaining my weight.  \n  \nA lot of people count carbs and don't have to count calories to lose weight. Or at least for a while. If you have the ability/desire to count calories, do it and you results will be more consistent/predictable results.  \n  \nThe great thing about eating keto is the effect on appetite. Beta hydroxybutyrate (the primary ketone body in the blood) is an appetite suppressant. Also, eating low carb, adequate protein, high fat necessarily will drive down insulin levels if you have high insulin (which is very likely if you are overweight). While I don't have numbers to back this up, but a year of keto basically fixed my insulin resistance, and, along with fasting, has repaired my hunger signaling and makes controlling my hunger and maintaining my weight easy without counting calories.

And then there are the high-protein, high-fat diets that many less qualified individuals are calling ketogenic. Ketosis is a starvation response, one doesn't get there with moderation. Children on true ketogenic diets, besides an unpalatable diet, experience [worse blood lipids](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=197131) and [bone loss](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/88/6/1678.long), and often [gastrointestinal disturbances, inflammation, and protein and mineral starvation](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0013-9580.2004.10004.x/full).\n\nAny high-protein diet can increase satiety and reduce calorie intake (likely via inducing [hypothalamic mTOR](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51506461_Leucine_nutrition_in_animals_and_humans_mTOR_signaling_3_and_beyond_Amino_Acids) signalling, though note mTOR activation also contributes to [aging and cancer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marion_Cornu/publication/234132551_MTOR_in_aging_metabolism_and_cancer/links/54c665620cf219bbe4f84335.pdf)), and weight loss often offers benefits that in the short term outweigh other, adverse effects of diets. However, weight loss cannot go on forever, so its important to look at longer term outcomes of lower-carb diets in individuals just maintaining weight: the epidemiology indicates these include [more cardiovascular disease](http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e4026) and [higher mortality](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055030).\n\nAnecdotally, I've encountered a few people who developed prediabetic insulin resistance after extended \"ketogenic-lite\" diets.

That's the etiology of type 2 diabetes. A notable study found that adding just 10% carbs to a ketogenic diet [raised insulin resistance to a maximal level](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0100875). I fear keto diet advocates, particularly those who aren't excluding carbs completely, are tickling the dragon of diabetes.\n",

            "text": "Dieticians: My doc said my blood sugar was a little high. So 20 days ago I quit eating obvious sugar such as sodas, candy, breakfast cereal, and desserts. I still eat fruit and some condiments.\n\nFor the first 7 days I lost 1 pound per day. I started at 187 pounds. (I'm 5' 11\".) And that doesn't surprise me so much.\n\nWhat surprises me is I've had back and knee pain for years and it seems to have subsided considerably. I've had athletes foot for years and that has almost disappeared completely. My appetite is reduced. And finally, I noticed my recovery time between workouts is almost half of what it was before removing sugar.\n\nWhat I'm asking is: In your opinion, did these changes occur because I (mostly) eliminated sugar from my diet?\n\nEDIT: In Lustig's lecture he says sugar/fructose/sucrose effects blood pressure. So after watching Lustig's video, I went down to the local Rite Aid and used their blood pressure machine (one I've used before). My b/p was 115/79. That's the lowest b/p I've had in 10 years.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your comments! Among them was a recommendation to check out Professor Lustig's video about sugar on YouTube, so I did. I just finished watching it and I recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their health. For what it's worth, you'll find my attempt at notes on Lustig's lecture below.\n\nRobert H. Lustig, MD, UCSF Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology, Sugar: The Bitter Truth (YouTube) 2007, University of California Television (UCTV)\n\nHi triglycerides and low hdl cholesterol = heart attack\nLow triglycerides and high hdl = healthy heart\n\nFructose doesn't provide any biochemical trigger to produce leptin or Ghrelin (the hunger hormones that tell us we're full).\nFructose also doesn't stimulate insulin production.\n\nFructose also results in more uric acid which increases our chance of gout.\nAlso the increased uric acid directly correlates with increased b/p.\n\nFructose = de novo lipogensis = fat.\n\nLustig's prescription:\nDrink only water and milk: Get rid of all sugared liquids.\nEat all carbohydrates with fiber.\nWait 20 minutes before eating a second portion (wait for the satiety signal).\nBuy your screen time with physical activity: minute for minute (admittedly, a difficult one).\n\nThe biggest problem with this prescription is sugar drink consumption.\n\nWhy is exercise so important to prevention of obesity:\nImproves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity\nReduces stress which reduces the release of cortisol. Stress and obesity goes hand in hand. \nMakes the TCA cycle run faster, and detoxifies fructose, improving hepatic insulin sensitivity. (Burns fructose off before it makes the fat.) (The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) is a series of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions that form a key part of aerobic respiration in cells. This cycle is also called the Krebs cycle and the citric acid cycle.)\n\nFiber: Wherever there's fructose in nature, there's fiber. When God created the poison, He created the antidote along with it.\n\nFiber:\nReduces the intestinal rate of carbohydrate absorption.\nIncreases the rate of transit which signals satiety (signal that we're full) quicker.\nReduces rate of absorption of fatty acids in the colon.\nMore fiber results in less fat.\n\nMcDonald's: Hi fructose corn syrup in everything except 7 items: coffee, tea, chicken mcnuggets, fries, sausage, hash browns\n\nObesity on the increase in 6 month olds: The more sugar the mother eats and drinks = more propensity for obesity in the baby. Also today's baby formulas are like a milk shakes.\n\nBiochemically, soda causes soda belly in the same way beer causes beer belly. The same number of calories hit the liver which is the key.\n\nEthanol (alcohol) is an acute toxin.\nFructose is a chronic toxin.\n\nBottom Line: Avoid Sucrose and high fructose corn syrup.",

            "text": "Hey Everyone,\n\nAfter reading a lot of research about how much egg white protein is absorbed as raw liquid compared to cooked, and with cooked egg whites having a much higher absorption percent, I decided to go with the cooked route. I wanted to try and eat a set amount of egg whites (8-10 oz.) and one whole egg every morning if possible. \n\nNow, eating 8-10 oz. of egg whites every single day isn\u2019t on everyone\u2019s bucket list, so it became old fast. The liquid doesn\u2019t look like much but becomes a lot when it\u2019s cooked! \n\nSo, I brainstormed on how to eat 10 oz. of egg whites and a whole egg day in and day out easier. My solution that I arrived at was blending up the egg whites AFTER they\u2019re cooked. This way, you still absorb the most protein out of them, and it\u2019s easy to get all the eggs down. What I do: Cook the egg whites, put around 90% of them in the freezer for around 10-15 minutes to cool, blend them up with cold water (and a splash of water flavoring) to your desired consistency, and chug it down. It\u2019s not the best tasting drink of all time, but it\u2019s very doable. The reason I only take 90% is because I do like eating something to help the hunger. \n\nTL:DR, if you hate eating a ton of egg whites every day, blending them up with water after cooking them will make it easy to consume while still getting the protein absorption we want.",

When most of the times that difference in absorption rates is irrelevant, doesn't matter wether A is more absorbable than B, when B is absorbable enough to easily satisfy your requirements.\n\nWhen it comes to protein, this is even more unnecessary, you won't have a protein defficiency no matter how you eat your eggs. And making protein more absorbable doesn't offer any benefit to your metabolism or heath. There's no point in eating that much egg whites, you say you're not even enjoying it, and for that reason as well as others that are important too, this dietary pattern goes against the basic principles of a healthy diet. \n\nEating raw egg tho is not recommended for various reasons.

There is evidence that the body has a certain weight range that it elegantly likes to stay at.\n\nWhen a person eats, they take in energy and too much energy will be stored as fat. Every one of us knows this already. But what has only been known in recently history, about the last 15 years, is that stored white fat functions like any other organ and it has receptor cells as well as a means to release hormones according to its needs. Fat cells release adipokine leptin (known just as leptin) which is the hormone which assists in making you feel full/satiated. The more fat cells you have, the more intensely this hormone will make you feel full. Unless you keep overeating, again and again and again, then the body will develop resistance to leptin and eventually you won't feel so full anymore. That's leptin resistance, which is highly associated with insulin resistance. They usually come hand in hand. Continuous of overconsumption will skew the body's perception of what is considered fat.\n\n*>Most of the recent research on body weight regulation is based on the idea that brain centers, including those located in the hypothalamus, receive peripheral signals reflecting energy and fat stores. Early parabiosis studies gave the first strong evidence that genetically obese mice lacked a secretory signal from adipose tissue which represses food intake \\[34\\]. One relevant homeostatic signal in body weight (or fat mass) regulation is the prototype adipokine leptin \\[35,36\\]. Leptin is derived from fat cells in proportion to fat mass, and one of leptin\u2019s tasks is to send signals regarding levels of fat mass (or changes in fat mass) to the hypothalamus, which in turn regulates both a decrease in energy intake and an increase in energy expenditure. This is an example of proportional feedback control, as food intake and energy expenditure are adjusted in proportion to the difference between plasma leptin concentration and its set point value \\[1\\].* \n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990627/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990627/)\n\nThe body wants to stay a certain weight. It's not advantageous to have TOO much fat. It also shows in the modern western society.\n\nThere's a lot of papers on this nowadays too. The brain and organs are all working together to regulate energy balance in the body.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22098800/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22098800/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6393248/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6393248/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19623201/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19623201/)\n\n(plenty more though)\n\nSome people argue that the body can't measure energy. Kilocalories is an arbitrary manmade unit of measurement. Right, but cellularly, ATP is the body's energy. Adenosine-tri-phosphate. How does the body know how much fat to store if it doesn't know how to measure energy? It does know. In nature, biological energy is in a sense, measured in ATP. The mitochondria uses ATP and allows you to move and live.",

When you\u2019re gaining weight, leptin is high - in a regulated system the fat cells produce leptin which goes to your hypothalamus to say \u201cstop eating, you\u2019re fat cells are full\u201d . Do this for too long and your cells become resistant to it, so it takes more leptin to create the same signal, which is a factor that contributes to obesity.\n\nAdiponectin is another one - except it works in an inverse way. Lean people\u2019s fat cells produce a lot, fat people\u2019s fat cells don\u2019t.\n\nThere\u2019s brown fat cells and white fat cells, the former burns calories the latter stores them - lots of rich hormonal signaling going on in the conversion of one to the other (which is theoretical).\n\nThese are all long term hormonal signals produced by fat cells. Digestive hormones are more immediate after eating, and it\u2019s these gut hormones that do more for hunger/fullness levels. Insulin, ghrelin, glucagon, pyy, glp-1, and other hormones called \u201cincretins\u201d do the hunger/fullness signaling. Theres also mechano- and baro- receptors that sense physical distenson (ie the expanding of the stomach). These are all produced by other organs, not fat cells.\n\nHope that helps! Why do you ask?",

Now when I'm hungry I have a big bowl of rice, legumes (black beans, kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, etc.), corn, peppers mushrooms onions, some lettuce. It ends up being an enormous volume of food while being very nutrient dense. If you eat like that you probably won't be hungry. \n\nA large bowl only ends up being 600-700 calories and coming from someone with what I used to think was an insatiable appetite (I could down 2-3 boxes of cereal, etc.), I just wasn't eating the right stuff.\n\nTL;DR Instead of restricting yourself, just eat more foods with high water/fiber/satiation content. If you're feeling really snackish, cut up 2-3 apples with some cinnamon and a cold glass of water; eat lots of fibrous plants/beans/etc. (you don't have to eat tomatoes and cucumbers all day) and stay hydrated.",

It's not so much because I want to lose weight but more because I just don't get hungry very often. I drink two to three protein shakes per day, mixed with milk (about 100g protein per day). And some days that's all I \"eat\".\n\nI realize this is not very good. I'm worried I'll put my body into a catatonic state which would just have the opposite effect of what I want.\n\nSo like I said. I don't eat much.

Isn't calorie intake the fundamental factor in all of this? So why would it matter where those calories came from? \n\nYes some food is more nutritious of course. People say nutritious food keeps you full for longer. But my problem isn't hunger and never was. So why can't I just have a bowl of m\u00fcsly with dried berries (probably with a bunch of sugar and stuff mixed in) just to get some fast 500 kcal? \n\nI don't do that's at the moment because I'm pretty sure I'm wrong about that...Otherwise people wouldn't be saying so, right? So instead I continue with my ultra low intake for most days. I occasionally have regular meals of course. It's not like I'm actively trying to starve myself here. Even had a pizza the other day. (God it was good.)\n\nSo yeah...Title is the question basically. :)\n\n(Please excuse my complete lack of knowledge in this subject. I suppose that's why I'm asking you guys.)\n\n",

I've not linked every paper I've read, but the literature seems to suggest:  \n\n\n* Capsaicin enhances prevalence of *Faecalibacteria* in the gut, increasing production of short-chain fatty acids\n* The increase in SCFAs has some influence on feelings of satiety, or else some other factor improves feelings of satiety and reduces hunger.\n* 25mg/day capsaicin in the diet appears to be sufficient to achieve a reduction in consumed calories.\n\nThoughts? I can't imagine many people having a pinch of chilli powder on their cornflakes every morning - perhaps the more experienced members might be able to suggest a potential practical application?",

Peptide YY is also released from the ileum and colon in response to feeding, so it also serves to inhibit hunger over much longer periods of time.

It's looking primarily at the hormone ghrelin, which is one the drivers for hunger. \n\nWhat it shows is that protein and carbs depress ghrelin for a long time. Carbs depress ghrelin significantly, but only for a relatively short period, and after a few hours, the ghrelin levels go up above the initial value. Looking at the data in the study, it appears that this is tied to the blood glucose level; during the time when glucose is elevated, ghrelin is low, but when the blood glucose normalizes it tends to dip below normal and that's triggering the rise in ghrelin and (presumably) increase in hunger. \n\nUnfortunately, most satiety studies only look at periods of 2-3 hours and presumably miss this  phenomena.",

            "text": "About a year and a half ago I was obese weighing 270lbs (6'0/M/21) and lost a huge amount of weight within a year on a very restrictive diet (<1200kcals + 5k runs 3 times a week) and at my lowest was around 135lbs. \n\nSince hitting the gym in September I seem to have gained some weight and have been much hungrier than before. \n\nI now weigh just under 160lbs, which I guess I am fine with, but I simply seem unable to satisfy my hunger. Even when I was obese I would get something like a \"filled up feeling\", but now I get nothing of the sort. \n\nI've tried so many foods typically known for filling you up like oats, salads, huge portions of veg, lean meat, fatty meat, nuts, yogurt and even combinations of fat, carbs and proteins, but I'm still not satisfied. This is a big problem around sugary food which I try to avoid like the plague, because I could eat it until I'm sick without ever feeling full. \n\nI want to lose some more body fat so recently I have been trying to eat only 1800kcals a day, but sometimes I get really hungry and then all dizzy and hot. I just grab a quick snack like some grapes or a bowl of oats, but this means I'm over my limit.\n\nI want to be able to eat intuitively, but without tracking my macros I could easily eat over 2000kcals a day and still be hungry. \n\nI really want to get down to a lower weight of about 150lbs again, but with this constant hunger I feel like I'm never going to make it.",

High fats also tend to relax the spinchter between your stomach and esophagus, which can give you a nauseous/no-longer-hungry feeling  (more of a concern for acid reflux sufferers like me).\n\nBlood sugar lows and nutrient needs can give you a \"I'm hungry\" feeling that isn't related to your stomach being full.",

Generally, your self-control will get worse because of a few factors, but the major ones are:\n\n(1) what you ate that day: If you restricted your caloric intake in the early hours of the day, then it's only natural that you'll be hungrier in the evening than if you hadn't been as restrictive. If you ate simple sugars, then your blood sugar level would spike and then drop to lower-than-before levels, leaving your hungrier. Not eating foods that properly fill you up will cause you to be much hungrier in the long run. Eating a breakfast full with proteins helps. Proteins don't get broken down as quickly, so you'll feel fuller for much longer. Also, I like to \"cheat\" by filling my breakfast up with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. that way I feel like I've eaten a lot, but it's all actually low-calorie and low-sugar. I then don't feel as hungry later on.\n\n(2) how tired you are: The more tired you are, the less self-control you will have. It's a real effort to not eat the things you crave. Your body knows that you'll have a huge increase in Dopamine if you eat that cookie and your ability to fight this urge will only weaken as you get more tired (makes sense, no?). This is where eating well earlier in the day will help you. You'll be less hungry and therefore also less likely to give in. If you do, don't beat yourself up about it. That'll just make you more likely to stress eat. But, do hold yourself responsible. You *did* eat that cookie, after all. Own up to it and resolve to not do it again. Take it day by day. Eventually, you'll no longer crave them and your self-control will be killer. It depends on the person, but it can take anywhere from 3 days to a couple of weeks. You can do this.",

I will admit that I followed the 1,200 calories a day diet for a while which did give me quick results but it's definitely not a sustainable way of eating and living. Diets are very short term, but changing your lifestyle is a more sustainable approach for the long-term. It's also important to have a healthy relationship with food. The risk with counting calories is that you start to become obsessive about it and there's a risk of developing disorderly eating habits because of it (there was a period when even the thought of eating started to stress me out, especially when I had no idea how many calories were in a meal). \n\nI no longer count calories but I try to eat as \"clean\" as possible and I've reduced my consumption of processed foods. For example, I've swapped out white rice for brown rice and I don't eat as much bread/pasta/wheat products as I used to. I took out sugar and milk from my diet too which helped with weight loss as well as improving the quality of my skin.

            "text": "This is something I've been researching and thinking about for a little while now, it's got some strong applications in the real world so I thought I'd write down my conclusions:\n\nSo I started with the common advice given to everyone, straight from 'the experts': \"Eat less and exercise more.\"\n\nThey say that\u2019s why obesity is at an all-time high, and that's why we all know at least one person with type II diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\nThey tell us to eat fewer calories, avoid fatty foods and exercise more.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but eating fewer calories makes me hungrier, avoiding fatty foods makes me crave them, and if I manage both those things - like hell do I have the energy to exercise more.\n\nThe root of the problem is our hunger. We\u2019re eating on average 300 kcal more than people did in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. Science has given us a name for why this might be happening: Leptin resistance.\n\nLeptin is a hormone produced by our fat cells to tell us when we are full. Leptin resistance is when our brain and gut stop listening to what leptin is saying, and we don\u2019t register when we\u2019ve had enough. We keep eating, one thing leads to another, and we end up buying new jeans.\n\nBut why is this happening to us? What\u2019s changed? \n\nThere\u2019s a theory that what we\u2019re eating is changing our gut microbiome, and our gut microbiome is leading the way to leptin resistance.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of the gut microbiome, it refers to the wealth of different bacteria living inside your gut - from your mouth, right the way through your stomach, through your bowels and out the other end. There are billions of bacteria (and viruses) living inside each of us - in fact there's more bacterial cells inside you than human ones!\n\nRecent science is telling us that the types and quantities of the little beasties living in your gut have a major impact on your life. They constitute a major part of your immune system, dictating whether you get sick, and they\u2019ve been associated with nearly every modern disease - especially obesity!\n\nSo we need to encourage the right microbes to make their home inside of us. Luckily, what we eat is what they\u2019re eating too. So we need to make sure that the menu is good for all the beneficial bacteria - those that boost health and performance, whilst making weight control effortless.\n\nOne way our diet can influence these bacteria, is by controlling whether or not the carbohydrates in our diet are cellular. The theory, proposed by Mr Ian Spreadbury, is that the large amounts of non-cellular carbohydrates in our diets are enabling populations of harmful, inflammatory bacterial species to flourish. In turn, this leads to the development of modern health problems including obesity and the rest of his pals.\n\nIn recent years, the volume of processed foods we\u2019ve been eating has rapidly increased, and a major component of these foods has been non-cellular carbohydrates.\n\nSo what\u2019s difference between cellular and non-cellular carbohydrates? How can we tell them apart?\n\nWell, cellular carbohydrates are foods that are made of cells (convenient naming). You could consider a \u2018cell\u2019 to be a unit of life, and all living things are composed of cells. So cellular foods are foods that were recently or are currently still alive.  \n\nCarbohydrate rich foods like bananas, apples, peaches and all other fruits/berries are cellular. The same goes for vegetables; roots, leafy greens, starches or otherwise. There\u2019s also nuts and seeds - containing less carbohydrates but both still made up of cells (and for the record, meat, fish and eggs are all cellular foods too even though they contain negligible carbohydrates).\n\nBack to our gut microbiomes, why would added sugars and flours lead to different populations of bacteria growing than cellular foods do? \n\nOne theory is based on the physical difference between these food types;\n\n They have radically different percentages of carbohydrates making up their total mass. \n\nWithin a cell, or even a whole food, you have a much more hydrated environment, or in simpler terms, there\u2019s a lot of water. This is particularly obvious if when you\u2019re trying to eat a ripe peach without getting sticky fingers. Flours and sugar on the other hand, are very dense, dry and often highly compacted.\n\nWhen we look at the numbers, in 100g of a banana (which for the record is a fruit that's relatively high in carbohydrates) you find roughly 23g of carbohydrates, a few micronutrients and not a whole lot of protein or fats. What are the other 75g or so that make up the rest of the banana? - That\u2019s right it\u2019s water.\n\nOn the other hand, let's look at 100g of wheat flour. Here we have 76g of carbohydrates and 10g of protein. That leaves less than 14g of water. \n\nTaking an ancestral look at diet, the bacteria that have been living in the human gut for the past tens of thousands of year will be used to a watery, cellular meal with fewer grams of carbohydrates in the mix by weight (aka the banana). These bacteria are used to breaking into cells and through organelle walls (cells have organs too!) to find the stored carbohydrates inside.\n\nBut if we introduce the processed food, dried out, non-cellular with a much higher density of carbohydrates, then these bacteria may not be capable of breaking down, absorbing, and metabolising these types of food. \n\nThere will always be other species of bacteria will have the skillset - they can use the dry, dense, non-cellular foods as a fuel source. And they will. And they\u2019ll multiply. These species of bacteria will thrive in this environment, but unfortunately, these are not necessarily the bacteria we want to be thriving in our gut. \n\nThese bacteria could be responsible for things like leptin resistance, the resultant weight gain, and the myriad of other modern metabolic diseases.\n\nIt's microbial warfare in your gut and you don\u2019t want to be supplying the wrong side. \n\nThere is more to this subject, but it would be too long to post with this, where I expand on what this means for some common dietary trends. If that interests you then let me know.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I've written some other stuff along these lines, PM me if you'd like more details, or some references",

If you can find some you're \"high\" self enjoys, you really can eat just about as much veggies as you can handle. \n\nFats:\n\n* Nuts, Salmon, Tuna, Peanut Butter, Olive Oil\n\nSkip:\n\n* Anything fried and processed foods\n\nGive yourself a weekly cheat meal where you can eat anything, but other than that, stick to the above foods and you'll be just fine.\n\nStart lifting weights, it will help you burn more calories and pack on more muscle than cardio. It doesn't matter how heavy they are if you're just starting, just remember to try and increase the weight every time you hit the gym (so long as you're getting adequate calories and protein, you should see increases in strength).\n\nTry to hit the gym more than twice a week... 800 calories over a week's time is like 115 calories a day, or **2** Double Stuff Oreos per day.\n\nFind someone who will hold you accountable for your actions.

            "text": "I ride bikes, and so hang out in cycling-related places and read cycling-related nutrition news from time to time.  Lately I've been wondering about ingested protein while in motion.\n\nFor the endurance rider types, taking in water, electrolytes, and carbs (mostly simple sugars) while riding is pretty important to keeping the endurance up (and from experience it absolutely makes a difference).  It's all about keeping glucose levels up and avoiding a \"bonk\".\n\nPeople who do tours or long distance rides also often eat in the saddle because hunger is pretty natural and you need food in general.  This is often just normal food, eaten from a handlebar bag or something while in motion, so as to avoid having to stop for whatever reason.\n\nBut what actually happens to the non-carb macros when they enter the bloodstream while you're still on the go?  Carbs get converted into glucose and provide energy, but what about the protein?  Does muscle, which breaks down a bit under use, repair at all while we're still awake?  Does the protein just get converted into yet more glucose via gluconeogenesis?  Is it just absorbed into various other processes?\n\nFats as well - do they get used for energy on the go, or do other things need to happen first, like running out of glucose?\n\nIn cycling terms these only come up in terms of recovery that I've seen, which leads me to believe they don't have an immediate effect.",

What is not generally appreciated is that amino acids can be converted directly into the compounds that are used in the citric acid cycle; that is in fact how they end up being converted to glucose in gluconeogenesis. Since they feed into the citric acid cycle, they can be fully oxidized in that cycle instead of being converted back to glucose. It is generally estimated that 10-15% of energy comes from oxidation of amino acids, but that figure will obviously depend on diet. \n\nFat... well, fat is a bit confusing.\n\nIn the base aerobic system, glucose gets converted to Acetyl CoA which is fed into the citric acid cycle, and fatty acids also get converted to Acetyl CoA and fed into the citric acid cycle. That is why I said the system is \"dual fuel\".\n\nHowever - these two systems are independent and subject to training effect \\*independently\\*. \n\nIf you are a high-carb cyclist - as I used to be - then there is generally a lot of glucose around. That means that you are training the glucose side of your base aerobic system. And that means that things operate the way you describe - it's all about trying to keep glucose levels up and avoiding running out of glycogen stores. There are numerous companies will to sell you a bunch of special products to make this better. \n\nIf you are in that state, fat really isn't used very much because the fat-burning system is not trained; it simply can't produce much power. \n\nConversely, if you regularly train in situations where there isn't much glucose around - the canonical way of doing this is fasted zone 2 training - then you will put training stress on the fat-burning side, and you will - over time - get much better at burning fat. That means much more of your base power can come from fat burning, which reduces the amount of glucose you are burning at that power level. That means you can eat less and still have your glycogen stores last as long or longer. Fueling in that situation becomes much easier. \n\nIt gets more complicated at higher intensities. At some point, you will run out of capacity to generate power from your base aerobic system. That point is determined by how much of that low intensity training you are doing. Above that point, your base aerobic system produces less power and the additional power comes from the lactate system, which sidesteps the aerobic system. That lactate system can only burn glucose.",

However, I was wondering if some of the \"healthy\" alternatives such as honey, agave, etc... have the same effect. I'm not talking about zero calorie sweeteners like Stevia or Splenda, just specifically honey (but if you know about the effects of similar substitutes such as agave and maple suryp, then feel free to give your thoughts) ",

            "text": "I have been bodybuilding for approximately a year now and I don't know about you guys but I have done tonnes of research and I thought I share my findings and experience with you guys. I definitely also find that these superfoods listed are the most beneficial to me for muscle growth and source of energy for my workouts.\n\n1) Salmon\n\nOne of the leading sources in Omega 3 fatty acids and it has 22g of protein per 100g. It is one of the most highest protein containing fishes out there and I personally favor it over tuna. Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce LDL cholesterol and also improve blood flow and circulation. It is also packed full with vitamin B12, selenium, vitamin D and niacin. Heck, you can even cook it several ways so you don't get bored.\n\n2) Eggs\n\nIt's a no brainer. Cheap and contains high amounts of protein, 3g in the egg whites and 3g in the yolk. It is also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins and minerals needed for muscle growth and repair\n\n3) Walnuts\n\nOne of the highest ranking nuts in terms of protein and also rich in manganese and Vitamin E. Just a one-ounce serving has more omega-3 than a 4 oz slice of salmon. Not to mention the tonnes of healthy fats in them that satisfies hunger and provides energy so you can blast that workout!\n\n4) Bananas\n\nBananas come in as one of the top fruits to consider as they not only contain simple fruit sugars, making them ideal for an insulin response after your workout, but also contain a decent level of starch carbohydrates as well, which will digest more slowly and help you maintain that energy for the long haul.\n\n5) Red meat\n\nOne of the best all-round foods to consume to build up muscle is red meat. It contains Vitamin B12, iron, protein, zinc, carnitine and creatine. The best type of red meat to invest in is grass-fed beef.\n\nWell, there you go. If you guys have any opinions, feel free to correct me. I would like to know other sources of superfoods as well. What are your opinions?",

Average aminoacid profile and you could get 23~ g of it with those calories with a shake or chicken.\n\n\n\n\nI would personally add Peanut Butter to that list, protein, monounsaturated fats and fiber in it, even though I agree it's bad for cutting.

That is to say, \"eat a snack between meals so that you're not tempted to eat as much during dinner\" and so on. I'm strictly talking about what's best for your body, operating on the presumption that you're not doing it just to limit what you eat in other meals, etc.\n\nRecently I've started the calorie counting game. My Fitness Pal, that sort of thing. But even before then I've found myself skipping lunch most days, mostly because I can focus and get my work done faster that way, and don't feel I need a break a lot of the time.\n\nBreakfast is usually a bowl of cereal. I drink plenty of water throughout the day, and that chases away the occasional hunger pangs.\n\nAnyone have insights as to number of meals per day, if it's necessarily a super bad thing to go through you're day (for me it's ~8 hours between breakfast and dinner) without eating (getting water still though)?",

From the fat storage point of view, simple biochemistry tells us that all three macronutrients are first converted into Acetyl-CoA, and if one consumes more calories than what one expends, that Acetyl-CoA will undergo lipogenesis (fat synthesis).  \n\nWhile insulin does drive fat storage, it also drives lipids to skeletal muscle for ATP production, protein synthesis of amino acids, glucose to tissues for ATP production, and glucose to liver and muscles for glycogen synthesis.\n\nI think our understanding of heart disease is slowly getting better with the new Dietary Recommendations listing dietary cholesterol as a nutrient not of concern.  Saturated fat is still recommended to be a very small part of one's diet since LDL increase is correlated with its consumption.  Though, there has been research that shows certain saturated fats also raise HDL, so maybe some saturated fats aren't so bad but more research needs to be done before giving a definitive answer.  Where Taubes and company may be right is higher sugar consumption contributes to heart disease as more research is showing this.\n\nPeople have showed Taubes came to questionable conclusions from the research he cited. His interpretation of the research that he used is not compatible with what the original authors found. \n\nOverall, alternative hypotheses like these are good for science since  it continues to question conventional wisdom, but the nutritional science community generally disagrees with what Taubes says. \n\nSorry I don't have the sources off hand to back up my claims.

They don't oversimplify \"current understanding\" - they challenge it fundamentally. Their main arguments are:\n\n1. Dietary fats are not, for most people, the health hazards which large parts of the medical establishment have claimed.  \n\n1. The calories-in calories-out model of weight homeostasis is at best over-simplified and likely deeply flawed.  \n\n1. Obesity is not the cause of hepatic steatosis, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, T2DM, Alzheimers and all the rest. It is but one further symptom of metabolic derangement.   \n\n1. Hypercalorific diets rich in dietary carbohydrates are instrumental in said metabolic derangement through as yet not fully understood mechanisms.   \n\n1.

            "title": "Hi, I have some questions about being healthy.",
            "text": "Hello. I stumbled upon this subreddit the other day when I was in my health class and learning all about how calorie intake vs outtake works. For a general indication of where I'm at. I am 18 years old, weight 205 lb, and am 5' 7. According to the BMI calculator I have a BMI of 33+ which really sucks and is depressing. After I realized how bad this is I started looking online on how to lose weight. \n\nI was absolutely amazed at the fact that even if you ate complete trash, as long as you ate below your calorie limit you would still lose weight. Once I downloaded myfitnesspal I realized just how far you can make 1300 calories stretch. I also realized just how many calories I was taking in on days that I would eat a little cesars pizza or other junk food that has insane amounts of calories. \n\nNow I get that eating crap food isn't healthy and even though I'll be losing weight I won't be a healthy person. I feel like it's going to help me big time though knowing that it doesn't matter what I eat but how much I eat. Using this myfitnesspal app has just made it so much easier and I am actually pretty excited. The hardest part for me when it has come to working out and eating healthy is not seeing immediate results. With the app, because I know that no matter what I do, if I follow the calorie count I will lose weight, it is so much easier to stick with it. \n\nAnyways, I have a couple of questions I wanted to ask if anyone wants to answer. I've googled a bunch of these but wanted input from this subreddit too. \n\n1) I take adderall every day. 10mg x 3 times a day. This has been insane for appetite suppression and also impulse control when it comes to eating. I now find myself eating junk food not because I want it so bad but because at the end of the day I let myself get too hungry and cant wait for a meal at home so I stop by a fastfood place. I have also noticed lately that my energy is crap and that my body can't handle the adderall as well. I feel like this is because I eat crap and don't eat foods that I need to in order to have the energy to support the adderall. So my question is how can I eat foods that are going to give me energy. I also would prefer foods that have low acidity so that the adderall can be absorbed better into my body. \n\n2) I hate vegetables. Like ever since I can remember the taste of mushy crappy lettuce, tomatoes, and almost every other veggie tastes like shit and makes me gag. I will literally start to throw up if someone forces me to eat them and I'm pretty sure I have thrown up in the past. The only exception is carrots, which I don't necessarily love but I can stomach them and eat them for fun. Other than carrots though, I hate every vegetable with a passion. What can I do if I hate veggies? I mean even one tiny shred of lettuce will ruin my day. I've never met anyone who hates them as much as I do and as much as I'd like to like them, I don't think I ever will and forcing myself to eat them just makes me angry. \n\n3) I am not meeting my calorie count often now that I started counting them. Now that I am using this tracker and avoiding those extreme foods like pizza, I am not getting anywhere near 1300 calories that MFP gives me. Yesterday I got 200 calories logged, and the day before that I got 700. I know this is unhealthy but with the adderall I can just forget hunger and focus on other stuff and before I know it the day is over and I have 200 calories logged. What foods should I be eating throughout the day to raise this calorie limit but still be losing weight (I know as long as I stay under I'll still lose weight, but I figure there is no point in eating more if I dont feel hungry, but I am guessing there probably is a point to eating normal and not so little). I kinda like the fact that im eating so little cause im assuming it will increase the speed at which I lose weight, but I also see online my body will lower my metabolism to cope with it. I'd basically love if there is foods that a) don't need to be prepared (like a snack that I can buy that is basically ready to eat) b)Gives me energy c) Is healthy. I don't like eating full meals and I don't know if it's possible to basically be able to eat \"snacks\" all day. I would much prefer this to having to eat a full meal because when I do need a full meal I end up just not eating at home and going to fast food. \n\nI know I have more questions but I most likely forgot them. I have crap memory and forgot to write all of these questions down as I've been thinking of them these past couple days so if I have more I will ask. Thank you so much to anyone who reads / gives answers. I think actually talking to people about it helps way more than googling the answer and not really knowing if it's right or not. \n\ntl;dr \n\n1) Foods that give energy?\n\n2) Hate veggies with a passion, what do I do. Can I just eat a shit load of carrots to get my veggie needs?\n\n3) Not meeting 1300 cals, usually 200-700 with the occasional over 1300 \n\n \n",

You should not be under 1500 calories a day MINIMUM.\n\nSecondly, your theory of *I can eat whatever I want and lose weight* is flawed. Weight loss is not only about calories in/calories out. The amount of sugar and salt you consume greatly affects your overall health. Not to mention, if you spend your calories on junk, you'll hit your daily calorie limit very quickly and find yourself hungry later in the day, resulting in over-eating. \n\nAs far as energy goes, exercise and nutritious foods will give you more energy. \n\nAs far as veggies go, you'll need to broaden your horizons a bit and start trying new veggies and cooking them in different ways, seasoning them lightly, hiding them with other foods, etc. Eating tons of carrots *will* turn your skin a shade of orange. \n\nIf you're having trouble meeting calories, plan your meals better. Weight loss takes time and effort and planning ahead. Use MFP and build yourself a whole day of eating and use that model to plan your meals.",

You need to use this level of repetition on yourself, including them in your meals.  If you were going to have pasta and chicken for dinner, add green beans or broccoli as a side dish, too.  \n\nTreat yourself like your own child discovering vegetables -  with love, patience, repetition, patience, and careful choices.  *Your goal is NOT to eat that serving of green veggies on the side of your plate tonight.*  Your goal is to just make that veggie (with cheese or tomato sauce or salad dressing, if you prefer, or not), and get it on your plate 20 times.  Challenge yourself a little bit every time it is served!  \n\n\nHere are my suggested challenges...  the first 3 times you make it, just serving it up at a meal a day is the challenge!  No pressure to eat it at all.  Notice how it smells.  Notice if the smell changes as it cooks.  Notice its color.  Pick it up or cut it up and take time to notice the texture...  is it firm?  Meaty?  Watery?  Think about it.  Really focus on the sensory elements of the veggie, get comfortable with it in a non-eating way.  \n\n Around Appearance #4 of a veggie, or when you are ready, you take the next step.  The next step is to put one bite in your mouth, but you have  zero pressure to swallow it.  You will have a napkin with you, and it's totally cool not to swallow that green bean.  Youve still met the goal if you put one bite in your mouth.  \n\nThe next challenge is chewing and swallowing a single bite.  Just one.  \n\nYou really need to treat yourself patiently with textural aversions so strong they trigger a gag reflex.  However veggie nutrition is important, too.\n\nI would suggest picking about 3 veggies to experiment with at first, ones which one day you would really like to include in your intake.  (Zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, green peas, or green beans are good to start with.)\n\nThe repetition thing will take awhile to be effective, though.  You can eat carrots in between those other-veggie-attempts.  Here's some other tips and ideas for in the meantime...\n\nHave you tried beets?  Theyre similar to carrots texturally, but even sweeter.  Honestly, i feel like beets are legitimately the most delicious vegetable.  Turnips are similarly textured too, but much less sweet.  \n\nHave you tried throwing some spinach into fruit smoothies if you ever eat those?\n\nIf you eat tomato sauces or soups regularly, you can sneak some pureed vegetables in there very easily.  \n\nYou can put half a chopped onion diced up per pound of meat, if you eat ground meat, and it's pretty well hidden texturally by the meat if you've diced it small.  I mean, it will infuse onion flavor-  so if you hate onion flavor, stay away from this idea.\n\nGood luck!  I hope sth i said was helpful.  <3\n",

            "text": "So except for the most insanely committed amongst us, most of us still drink and/or indulge in big food nights from time to time.  Generally, we do it within reason and plan ahead to accommodate the extra calories, etc.\n\nHowever, the problem I've ran into is this:  the next day.  Whenever I indulge in food and/or alcohol, I find that I'm absolutely ravenous the next day.  No amount of eating satisfies me.  This makes diet discipline dramatically more difficult, and it's easy to cause a slide.\n\nThis appears to be caused because the night before threw your blood sugar out of whack.  So have you guys found any food tips or strategies to help get your blood sugar and your body back on track after a \"night out?\"  Any specific foods, supplements, etc.?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not talking about hangover cures.  That's a different topic.  I'm simply talking about getting the blood sugar and such back on track in order to get the hunger/cravings back to normal.\n\nOne thing I've researched is that drinking can interfere with Glutamine production, which plays a role in regulating sleep, metabolism, etc.  So I may experiment with supplementing Glutamine before and after.",

For example, I skipped lunch the other day and about 2 hours after I normally eat, I started shaking when I tried to walk, I felt sick to my stomach, I was extremely drowsy, and my hunger pains were almost unbearable. I know this sounds melodramatic, but skipping a meal is about the most miserable experience I've ever felt. I know most people don't react this way to skipping a meal.\n\nWhy do I react this way? I normally have to eat four or five small meals a day in order to keep up my energy and stave off shakiness.

You are *not* overloading on carbs, unless you're eating a huge portion of cereal and a loaf of banana bread.  \"Cut Carbs!\" is the go to advice around here, even when it's not applicable.  Simple carbohydrates will digest faster and won't keep you feeling full for as long (ex: white breads, white rice, refined sugar), so if you're consuming those, try substituting for complex carbohydrates that have 3g's of fiber or more per serving.  Fiber is extremely sating, especially when consumed with adequate fluid.   There also appears to be a lack of fat in your diet.  Fat slows the digestion process and makes you feel satisfied for longer.  \n\nDepending on your gender, height, and weight, and knowing your portion sizes, it's hard to give you accurate advice.

A loaf of bread or some rice can be cheap. Meat, notsomuch. YMMV.\n\nI am not fat adapted. I have no idea if and when that will ever happen. Consequently I am not metabolising my primary energy source as efficiently as I need to be, which is the whole point of this diet. When people argue this is how human's are 'meant' to be, I find that too simplistic to take seriously. I can't disprove the claim, but on the basis of the fact we seem to be sugar burners by default and that adapting to fat takes months, I say no. Consequently I feel tiredn more than I used to be. \n\nI don't think fat is the enemy: i don't believe it makes you fat, though it has, for now, raised my cholesterol somewhat. In fact I had my bloods looked at recently. I could post the results. I was also told that my iron is lower than normal (they want to look again so I have to go back) and that I have some markers related to asthma which I have never suffered from. I don't know whether that means keto can make you asthmatic. The doctor didn't think these, along wiht my cholesterol, were urgent.\n\nIt is claimed that fat is satiating and that on keto one should eat until full using fat to maintain satiety. I have not really found this to be the case except for the first couple of weeks on the diet. After which I have experienced hunger returning very quickly. \n\nI used to be this way. I changed my diet, which was not a good diet (too much wheat, rice, junk), because I was occasionally prone to blood sugar lows and I wanted that stabilised. I believe that is the case now, but through radical measures that I am not convinced are sustainable.\n\nSome people seem to thrive on this diet, but it comes at the cost of excluding, by necessity, a lot of otherwise apparently healthy food. \n\nKeto advocates cannot agree on anything. It is claimed too much protein can trigger glucose, but they can't tell you how much.\n\nIf you get hungry you are told to eat more fat. For example, drink Bulletproof Coffee. I can't. I don't like coffee and have found adding fat to, for example, peppermint tea to be unfilling. I am not convinced fat is as satiating as protein at all. \n\nThere is a possibility I have an aberrant metabolism of some kind. So keto may not work for me at all. But honestly, it is such hard work.\n\nThe evidence put forward by its adovcates is compelling, and I can't debunk it. I certainly haven't read it all, not even close. I think there are some benefits. But the amount of fat is hard work. Weight loss isn't even my primary concern: i've lost some, but nowhere near as much as some people claim to have lost themselves.\n\nI don't know whether I should give up or not. I would like to know for sure what the evidence really says - assuming the case is closed. It does seem that the case against fats isn't as clear cut as dietary orthodoxy would suggest, but the research at best seems to say \"it's not unhealthy\", which is a far cry from claiming it is healthy.\n\nThanks for reading.",

                    "comment_text": "I think you should stop keto seeing that it doesn't work and your blood panels are a bit worrying.  I do keto and have been doing it for the past 1.5 years and have no desire to stop. Not everyone does well on keto just like every diets. You should just trial and error and slowly introduce different types of foods to see which is most suitable. Another alternative is to look into plant based fat as keto. \n\nAll I can offer you is my experience so take it for what its worth. I am diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome so it somewhat makes me insulin resistant. My family also has a history of diabetes especially my grandfather who had also NAFLD which he has since reversed through diet and medication. \n\n1.5 years ago, I wanted to get off birth control that I had taken for 2 years because I was gaining weight. My gynae then told me to try low carb. Coupled together with tips from my grandfather's endocrinologist, I figured Keto seems to be the answer. Imagined my surprise when the endocrinologist prescribed my grandfather a diet that was <100g net carbs that was rich in fish, tofu, vegetables, unsaturated fat and also calorie restricted. \n\nI did started with the classic keto but after a few months, it started tasting horrid to me and I slowly transited into a keto mediterrean version. My fat now comes mainly from avocados, fatty fish, nuts and olives. I do eat poultry, cheese and eggs and sometimes beef and pork. Fibre from vegetables is eaten freely, I don't limit it. I personally don't find the diet hard to stick to. \n\nFat in itself is not satiating although there is [a study that says olive oil is quite satiating](https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/detail/article/30517/) but when combined with protein and fibre, the satiaty increases. I think the reason why the people over at r/keto are telling you to eat more fat could be because they are obese and came from a terrible refine sugar diet that is way less satiating. So in a sense, keto is a easier diet for them to stick to as they aren't calorie restricting on fat. But in another sense it is a form of calorie restriction from their previous diet. \n\nWhat I eat now is 65% fat, 30% protein and 5-10% net carbs. I don't take any supplements.  My results were I lost weight, got rid of my PCOS symptoms which were the horrible painful periods, acne and improved overall health. My body fat dropped and the increased energy levels made me exercise a lot more. I actually gained muscle from lifting.  \n\nI won't attribute everything to totally keto because I know exercise plays a pretty big role as well. Like you grains don't work particularly well with me. I tend to get sleepy after eating them and it did not really improve my PCOS. \n\nYou aren't gonna get a lot of responses here because this sub is a warzone between vegans and keto. Keto isn't generally accepted as the  mainstream ideal nutrition",

I'm sorry to hear that you haven't had the results that you imagined with keto, but hey, at least you found something that doesn't work. Y'know, people have always said that the type of diets where you completely cut out food groups are unsustainable/unreasonable. The rest of my post will be able my two cents.\n\nThat being said, maybe keto for 7 week is too much? I just completed week 1 of cutting on keto and I'm trying to feel things out too. That being said, I think that a lot of what people are saying out there are just ploys to get you to buy into an idea. I believe they want you to buy into the idea of keto so they can benefit in some way (either by selling you stuff, or getting advertising revenue from multiple website visits--frankly, I think the whole nutrition and fitness industry is like this).\n\nI think a good takeaway you can get from this experience is that you've learned to listen to  your body and its responses to hunger. I've found that fat by itself isn't the most filling, but rather consuming \"complex and complete diet\" of carbs+fat+protein usually does enough. On keto, I found myself eating extra salad (4 cups of leaves) with more than average amounts olive oil and some protein worked for me on most meals. The veggies really do help make you feel full (from the sheer volume), and the poops are glorious too.\n\nAlso, another thing, I've had to boost salt levels in all of my food (because you have to cook everything and lose out on the salt added to everything pre-made), otherwise I would just be lacking those basic electrolytes. Setting aside a spoonful every day and using it sparingly throughout my meals seem to help me get through gym sessions. That and taking some extra potassium, fish oil, and medium chain triglycerides (MCT).\n\nLastly, I've had to increase the amount of water I've been taking in. The lack of salt and glucose makes it hard for my body to hold on to water weight.\n\nAnyway, I think you've earned a well-deserved break from this diet",

I don't know how much of it has been from keto. What this diet change did was make me think about my eating more.\n\nI don't know how familiar you are with 'mindful eating', but that's been the game-changer for me. I've been into mindfulness & meditation these past couple years, and I never thought to apply it to my eating as well. With mindful eating, my normal 1500cal per day satisfies me pretty easily. A few days ago I ate 1000 as a test, and I wasn't hungry throughout the day. Not sustainable, obviously, it was simply a test of how much control I could have. Since starting that, I have not unintentionally overeaten a single time. I've been intentionally undereating a few times this week, and it hasn't felt too detrimental for me. Since I'm pretty active I'll avoid going too little.\n\nBut anyway, for someone who's has a history of binging a lot, making this change has produced this phenomenal consistency, and I plan to start carbs again and see if I still have that. \n\nKeto is expensive, and it takes a lot of effort to sustain, but I have gotten a lot of out it. For me, that's more important than the diet itself.",

Or does it always know and therefore left with feelings of hunger?\n\nI am going to be experimenting on myself the next few days to see if I eat a certain volume instinctively, even if all of my RDA were maxed in the first 1200 calories, and how it affects hunger levels, if at all.

The cover was blown off the crash dieting long ago, but now has the scientific backing to show it is entirely unsustainable\n\nSee: [NY Times Article on Biggest Loser](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/health/biggest-loser-weight-loss.html)\n\nThere is also evidence that gut micribiota has a role to play in adiposity (fatness/weight gain), as evidenced in this study: [The Gut Microbiota Reduces Leptin Sensitivity and the Expression of the Obesity-Suppressing Neuropeptides Proglucagon \\(Gcg\\) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor \\(Bdnf\\) in the Central Nervous System](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/en.2012-2151)\n\nTherefore, it is important to take into account that chemical signaling in the body plays HUGELY into the ability to lose weight, and to keep it off. Those who recommend CICO are being too simplistic, because not every biome is primed to be efficient in chemical signaling. \n\nWhat I would recommend is making slow, sustainable changes to your diet. Of course, some sensible recommendations have been made already, such as eating more vegetables, and removing all added sugars. Exercise is also overrated. Dieting can already be an added stressor to your body, which can alter chemical signaling, and reduce metabolism, mess up your micribiota, etc. I'd recommend gentle exercises, 30 minutes of walking or biking, every day. Biggest thing is to listen to your body. If you feel tired, rest. If you feel hungry, eat (but only to satiety). Removing sugars, including even all fruits, has helped me to lose 10 pounds in one month. I barely exercise, and I don't count calories. I only eat until I am full, then I don't eat anymore. I also take S. Boullardii and a multi-probiotic supplement. That's it. \n\nEDIT: Already downvoted, and why? Oh, that's right, this is /r/nutrition, I forget that science, reason, and evidence (as well as open minds) are unwelcome around these parts....",

This is starting to freak me out, so I've compiled a list of sources/interesting places to follow updates for the hose interested. First, some key items I've gleaned out. Feel free to issue corrections:\n\n- Disease first appeared in October, and was reported by authorities last week\n- The affected province (Kwango) is very remote with limited healthcare access/resources. Roughly 40% of children in the area suffer from malnutrition \n- Local authorities report 382 people presenting symptoms of this disease are registered in seven of the thirty health areas in the zone\n- Deaths reported as between 67-143, depending on the source. Translated press conference seemed to indicate ~130 dead.\n- Women and children most affected, with over half the cases in children under 5 (read this somewhere, having trouble finding the source).\n- Disease is an Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) that presents with flu-like symptoms Symptoms including fever, headache, cough/runny nose. Severe cases have included difficulty breathing and anemia.\n- Minister of Health Roger Jamba stated \"We are more or less in the affirmation that it is respiratory,\" but no theories have been ruled out, including Ebola, Hemorrhagic Fever, or influenza. \n- The WHO has sent a team to the site to assist in laboratory analysis. Results are expected later due to the remoteness of the site and the fact that samples have to travel ~500km to the lab.\n\nPersonally, I'm very worried that the cause has not been identified yet, and the mortality rate seems (at this point) quite significant. Does anyone have any insight to share on this? Is there anything that might calm the nerves?\n\nhttps://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/africa/emerging-diseases-other-health-threats-ah/1001427-drc-kwango-several-deaths-due-to-an-epidemic-of-unknown-origin-reported-in-panzi#post1001764\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2024/12/05/mystery-illness-congo-cause-remains-under-investigation-79-fatalities/",

            "text": "Hi everyone!! So I am brand new to the public health world and honestly only really learned about it this past month. I have been a pre-health student for many years now. I am 3 years out from my undergrad and am deciding between MD, PA, or pursuing a career in public health.\n\nMy passion and interest in medicine and public health is as follows - I am extremely interested in the human body and how it works. In terms of the impact I want to make and the day to day work that really drives me, i am very passionate about serving underserved communities. I recently volunteered in Tanzania in the Emergency Department and absolutely fell in love with the impact we were able to make there. I want to continue to do this type of work. In tanzania I decided to go ahead and pursue an MD, but when i came back to the states I was unsure about it because of the long years, high stress, and the fact that i don't want to be a typical physician that only sees patients every day. My ideal goal in my career would be to be able to open non-profits that go to third world countries and provide help, support, and guidance in multiple ways. We had a lot of nonprofits while I was in TZ that came from the US and performed surgeries, donated equipment, and ran educational seminars on topics such as malnutrition, disease prevention, etc. This is really what Im passionate about. I also am someone that can get bored fast, and i don't want a degree or career that only allows me to do one thing forever. I want to be able to make an impact in many ways and work in different fields of medicine. I'm considering doing a PA and also a MPH/DRPH? That seems like it allows me the most amount of flexibility in terms of making an impact, but I'm really not sure. Any advice would be so much appreciated!\n\nForgot to mention - i am also extremely interested in healthcare innovation. This field of healthcare would still allow me to use creativity as well as science and practicality. Considered an MBA for this reason as well.",

While well-intentioned the approach you describe: opening non-profits and parachuting into countries to be a saviour to bring goods/initiatives that you as an external party believe to be needed until you get bored is both paternalistic and also doesn't meaningfully address broader issues related to health systems, poverty, etc. As well, if you're interested in providing support, help, & guidance there are loads of opportunities to do this work in your own backyard.  \n  \nBased on the many different career opportunities you are currently considering & how quickly you get bored I would recommend working for a few years post undergrad ideally in areas related to these fields.

            "text": "Analysis of the mid-Victorian period in the U.K. reveals that life expectancy at age 5 was as good or better than exists today, and the incidence of degenerative disease was 10% of ours. Their levels of physical activity and hence calorific intakes were approximately twice ours. They had relatively little access to alcohol and tobacco; and due to their correspondingly high intake of fruits, whole grains, oily fish and vegetables, they consumed levels of micro- and phytonutrients at approximately ten times the levels considered normal today. This paper relates the nutritional status of the mid-Victorians to their freedom from degenerative disease; and extrapolates recommendations for the cost-effective improvement of public health today.\u201d Well, gosh\u2026 The author of this and other self-plagiarising papers is very busy in the academic journals, and all the papers hammer away at the same theme.\n\nThe first question such an abstract raises is, unavoidably, \u201cIs it true?\u201d. And there, really, you have it. I do not argue at this point with the idea that better-off working class Victorians consumed a greater range of micronutrients than the modern proletariat: I simply ask, initially, \u201cWas life expectancy at 5 really anything like what it is today?\u201d And so I went looking for the author\u2019s source. Which is, for those figures, The Health of Adult Britain 1841-1994, 2 Volumes; Charlton, J., Murphy, M., Eds. 2004.\n\nNow, this book isn\u2019t available online, so I can\u2019t check their statistics. But I can check papers which have used the same source for their own figures, and oddly enough they all seem to write that life expectancy at five is NOT the same as it was in 1860: quite the reverse. As do all the statistical sources I did find. The \u201cworld in data\u201d figures say life expectancy at five is now over 30 years better than it was in the mid-19thC. In fact, the only sources I stumble across which say they are the same\u2026 are by Rowbotham, J. who has noised the \u2018fact\u2019 abroad in a number of journals.\n\nSurely these are peer-reviewed? Surely someone has gone in search of the statistics, to scratch their head over why other sources give a totally different set of figures?\n\nOne thing does occur to the inquiring mind: Rowbotham has no clear idea how cohorts work. Her argument is that the diet was so brilliant in the years 1850-1880, that those years saw a high life expectancy once infant mortality was excluded. Now, certainly infant mortality in the two decades before her selected period of Great Food was abnormally high, due to a flurry of epidemics and hunger. This would mean, incidentally, that the cohort of young people living through the 1850-1880 period had been well weeded-out of weaklings. But if those people are going to have a good life expectancy, they aren\u2019t going to be dying in the mid Victorian period, they\u2019re going to live on till the end of the century and beyond. The people dying at those allegedly impressive advanced ages in the 1850s-1880s were, if you see my point, born a good while beforehand. Someone reaching their three score years and ten (and another few for luck) in the 1860s was born in the 1790s\u2026\n\nRowbotham\u2019s diagrams show us, with nasty black bits on the graph, how our ancestors died of infectious diseases while we all get cancer. We get cancer, according to her, because we don\u2019t eat that fabulous mid-Victorian diet. The fact that cancer doesn\u2019t just affect burger-noshing cola-swilling slobs but also strikes down vegetarians and those who cultivate their allotments is an inconvenient truth which we shall ignore for now. If this is the crux of the matter, then is it the OLDER cohort: those in their forties to sixties, most at risk of cancer, who would be benefitting from all those splendid micronutrients? Or the youngsters?\n\nAs it happens, Rowbotham argues, as evidence for the rapid and tragic decline in dietary standards, that in 1883 the army had to reduce the minimum height requirement for recruits. Eh, what? In 1883? Ms Rowbotham, it may have escaped your notice, but the army also has a minimum AGE  requirement. Technically, \u201cboy soldiers\u201d could enlist, in extreme cases, as young as twelve to fourteen, but these were not normal recruits, who were expected to be seventeen. But even those boy soldiers had grown up during that period of Great Food, when people were so egregiously well-nourished. So why were the recruits allegedly so defectively short as soon as 1883? The reasoning doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nCut it any way you like, the effects of a tightly constrained period of Great Food, sandwiched between the malnutrition of the Hungry Forties and the decline of the 1880s is unlikely to be expressed in the statistics precisely within those dates. If the Great Food is so efficacious in preventing cancer, we should expect to see an increase in cancer rates in the late 19thC.\n\nDo we? And if we do, what does it tell us? The short answer is \u201cbugger all\u201d. The big change in mortality rates in the late 19th century is a decline in infectious disease. The big news over the whole century and a half is a decline in deaths from infectious disease. The main reason deaths from cancer form such a substantial block in that nasty graph is that deaths from infectious disease in the 2019 figures have shrunk to a vestigial trace. Even the \u201cdiseases of affluence\u201d which Rowbotham considers were largely restricted to the better-off, circulatory diseases and stroke, have shrunk away with modern medicine.\n\nhere is an editor of the very book cited, talking about cohorts, and making it very plain in his graphs that life expectancy was NOT as good in the 1860s as it is now\u2026https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/pp151184.pdf\n\nOn 19th century medical attitudes to cancer https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1449359/\n\nView on Patreon.

            "text": "Dear Colleagues,  \n\nI am intrigued regarding the following situation.  \n\nThe book \"Murray CJL, eds. The Global Burden of Disease: A comprehensive assessment of mortality and disability from diseases, injuries, and risk factors in 1990 and projected to 2020. 1996. WHO & World Bank\", refers to a \"Global Burden of Disease and Injury Series\" of publications, of which the book is the first (hence, and from hereon, referred to as 'GBD vol1').  \n\nIt goes to say that there was planned to be 9 volumes.:  \nvol 1: the book i mentioned above, summarising the series  \nvol 2: underlying epid stats for over 200 conditions  \nvol 3: reproductive health  \nvol 4: infectious diseases  \nvol 5: NCDs  \nvol 6: neurological and psychiatric  \nvol 7: injury  \nvol 8: malnutrition  \nvol 9: burden due to risk factors  \n\nHowever, I believe that not all these plans have materialised, or not in the way it was planned. WHO's page on GBD informs of publications regarding GBD (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/publications/en/). In this page, it seems to suggest that there has been several books published that one is left to assume correspond to at least some (but not all) of the volumes initially planned in the GBD vol 1. For instance, the book \"Global health risks : mortality and burden of disease attributable to selected major risks. 2009. World Health Organization\" (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/global_health_risks/en/), and the other books related to the burden posed by health risks (http://dcp-3.org/dcp2; http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/cra/en/; http://www.who.int/whr/2002/en/) are assumed to relate to volume 9: Burden posed by risk factors. However, these do not mention or acknowledge their adherence to the publishing framework first suggested in GBD vol1 or for that matter the phrase \"Global Burden of Disease and Injury Series\".  \n\nAlso, the page regarding GBD-relevant WHO pubblications does not mention some WHO publications that have reported on the topics of the planned GBD series volumes, including NCD (Global Status reports on NCD http://www.who.int/nmh/publications/en/); or neurological/psychiatric (http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurodiso/en/).  \n\nAm I right in this thinking? If so, why has events transpired that the original framework is not adhered to?  \n\nChange of leadership? change of strategic direction? new results that make the framework obsolete? etc.  \n\nI'd be grateful for any ideas and insights.  \n\nThank you.",

I would love to pick your brain on this!\n\nI am well-aware of the notion *THAT* food deserts exist in the United States and that lower-income people of color within food deserts either do not have access to healthy options or that healthy options are relatively inaccessible for largely financial reasons, issues of proximity, etc. I have watched videos summarizing them, and how access to affordable, nutritious foods, like fresh produce and the like, are more accessible in higher income predominantly white communities. I understand that fruits and vegetables in many corner stores within food deserts are actually more expensive than their equivalents in the aforementioned grocers in white, higher income communities. Confound that with the fact that many people in lower income communities of color rely on public transportation, may be working three jobs to live paycheck-to-paycheck make accessing healthy food options either a significant systemic challenge or nigh impossible. This has massive implications for obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular issues, and nutrient deficiencies. It's a huge and horrible problem. \n\nThis aspect of the discussion I understand. \n\nWhat I rarely have heard about is what does a diet in a food desert, based on the public health research that has been conducted in food deserts throughout the United States, actually look like? In other words, what does the research suggest people are actually eating within food deserts? How are people spreading their dollars or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to meet any vague notion of nutritional needs for themselves and their families, even if those needs are chiefly just staving off hunger and living another day. \n\nI would greatly appreciate some input on this.

            "text": "I came here to see if anyone agrees with me about this. I got my MPH in social and behavioral health/health education. Every public health school has a version of this program. The school I went to was amazing and the classes, professors and work opportunities were very high quality. I got a great job in program evaluation right after graduating.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though. After taking 2 years of classes, working at a research center for 2 years, having an internship at a government agency, then working for a few years in evaluation (and attending conferences and whatnot)\u2026.I kind of think that public health quantitative research is all\u2026.bullshit? I honestly do not think we can truly measure behavior change or attitude change and really determine if a program or intervention \u201cworked\u201d with the methods that we usually use (such as a pre/post survey, regression, etc.) I think that all of the \u201ctheories\u201d we learned in school that we use to develop research questions and analyze data are meaningless. I now think evaluation is a complete waste of time and it\u2019s impossible to actually collect meaningful data when it comes to health behavior and attitudes. \n\nFor example - I saw a report that a program that provided free food to impoverished people was cancelled because an evaluation of the program showed that it \u201cdidn\u2019t solve the issue of chronic hunger in the long-term\u201d. How on earth could giving free food to hungry people NOT work??? If this evaluation was a survey, wouldn\u2019t people be somewhat incentivized to say that they were still hungry so that the program would continue? This is just one example, but there are so many out there. \n\nThis realization makes me really sad because I feel like I wasted my time and money and now I\u2019m stuck in a career that I think is useless. I wish I had studied epidemiology so I could have a meaningful career in public health. I wonder if anybody feels the same?",

The tools we (and may other disciplines, as another comment pointed out) use to evaluate quantitative outcomes may not be perfect but they are what have proven to give us the insight we need to understand whether or not interventions, etc are doing what they're intended to do.\n\n>For example - I saw a report that a program that provided free food to impoverished people was cancelled because an evaluation of the program showed that it \u201cdidn\u2019t solve the issue of chronic hunger in the long-term\u201d.

If this evaluation was a survey, wouldn\u2019t people be somewhat incentivized to say that they were still hungry so that the program would continue?\n\nWhile I completely disagree with their decision to cancel a free food program, the results were probably right - simply giving people free food didn't solve the long-term issue of chronic hunger because the issue of long-term, chronic hunger is systemic. Just my opinion but giving free food is a band-aid solution to a much bigger problem (we need to fix what causes people to go hungry in the first place despite there being more than enough food available). I also disagree that people would be incentivized to say they \"were still hungry\" so that the program would continue (which implies they are lying on the survey). You could say the same thing but the opposite - that they would feel incentivized to say that they are no longer hungry because of the program so that the program continues. Also, if people were to have lied saying they were still hungry despite the free food, doesn't that justify the results? That the free food didn't help their hunger? \n\nTbh I read your post and feel like what I'm actually reading is a deeper frustration towards the systems in place. Maybe I'm wrong. If not though I totally feel you on this. I'm on the qualitative side of pubic health and constantly feel frustrated with the way things go because of the powers in place. Last year I landed (what I thought would be) my first real role in public health, working for the county health department. I thought this was it - my foot was in the door and I could finally do the things public health was meant to do. I was quickly jaded by the powers at hand - real public health changes were not being made, it was just a slow cycling through the same old motions with the same old people making decisions regardless of input and suggestions made by us working directly with the public/specific populations. Coupled with my experiences in prior jobs, I decided to leave the \"normal\" public health workforce altogether in order to pursue my own thing. I know I'm in a privileged space to be able to do so but I just couldn't handle it anymore - I want to make real change, even if it's small and one person/family at a time.

But my personal and professional opinion is that this is why it is so important to do program evaluation, regardless of what type of science it is based in.\n\nHow do we know something is \"working\" if it isn't evaluated? Programs cost a lot in terms of money, time, personnel, etc so the program needs to be effective to continue funding the resources needed.. More importantly - what is the purpose/goal? In your example, is it to just feed people, or does it go beyond that (another commenter alluded to this)? In public health we are often focused on food accessibility and prevention of chronic disease - often healthy food access becomes the main driver in relation to both of those issues. So we're probably looking at the environment, the culture and the skills/knowledge a person has. Can people afford groceries? Where are people living in proximity to a grocery store or farmers market? How much does it cost to buy groceries for a week vs stopping at a drive thru/going to the food bank? Do the people being served by the program know how to cook? Do they have the proper cooking equipment and food storage in their home? Are they able to prioritize time to shop, prep food and cook? Etc. Etc.\n\nBehavioral science is complex and we are trying to change a lot of things to motivate a person to change a behavior. Sometimes we have to take it step by step and do many things... provide education and awareness to change their attitudes and beliefs, create policies that help remove or create certain barriers, change the landscape of the environment, incorporate sustainable incentives to promote the behavior, build a coalition to empower the community... and each of those specific strategies should be evaluated to know if they accomplished what you set out to do.\n\nI see value in evaluation because it is good science to measure what the program is doing and if it is resulting in the behavior change/outcome you want to achieve.",

            "text": "Analysis of the mid-Victorian period in the U.K. reveals that life expectancy at age 5 was as good or better than exists today, and the incidence of degenerative disease was 10% of ours. Their levels of physical activity and hence calorific intakes were approximately twice ours. They had relatively little access to alcohol and tobacco; and due to their correspondingly high intake of fruits, whole grains, oily fish and vegetables, they consumed levels of micro- and phytonutrients at approximately ten times the levels considered normal today. This paper relates the nutritional status of the mid-Victorians to their freedom from degenerative disease; and extrapolates recommendations for the cost-effective improvement of public health today.\u201d Well, gosh\u2026 The author of this and other self-plagiarising papers is very busy in the academic journals, and all the papers hammer away at the same theme.\n\nThe first question such an abstract raises is, unavoidably, \u201cIs it true?\u201d. And there, really, you have it. I do not argue at this point with the idea that better-off working class Victorians consumed a greater range of micronutrients than the modern proletariat: I simply ask, initially, \u201cWas life expectancy at 5 really anything like what it is today?\u201d And so I went looking for the author\u2019s source. Which is, for those figures, The Health of Adult Britain 1841-1994, 2 Volumes; Charlton, J., Murphy, M., Eds. 2004.\n\nNow, this book isn\u2019t available online, so I can\u2019t check their statistics. But I can check papers which have used the same source for their own figures, and oddly enough they all seem to write that life expectancy at five is NOT the same as it was in 1860: quite the reverse. As do all the statistical sources I did find. The \u201cworld in data\u201d figures say life expectancy at five is now over 30 years better than it was in the mid-19thC. In fact, the only sources I stumble across which say they are the same\u2026 are by Rowbotham, J. who has noised the \u2018fact\u2019 abroad in a number of journals.\n\nSurely these are peer-reviewed? Surely someone has gone in search of the statistics, to scratch their head over why other sources give a totally different set of figures?\n\nOne thing does occur to the inquiring mind: Rowbotham has no clear idea how cohorts work. Her argument is that the diet was so brilliant in the years 1850-1880, that those years saw a high life expectancy once infant mortality was excluded. Now, certainly infant mortality in the two decades before her selected period of Great Food was abnormally high, due to a flurry of epidemics and hunger. This would mean, incidentally, that the cohort of young people living through the 1850-1880 period had been well weeded-out of weaklings. But if those people are going to have a good life expectancy, they aren\u2019t going to be dying in the mid Victorian period, they\u2019re going to live on till the end of the century and beyond. The people dying at those allegedly impressive advanced ages in the 1850s-1880s were, if you see my point, born a good while beforehand. Someone reaching their three score years and ten (and another few for luck) in the 1860s was born in the 1790s\u2026\n\nRowbotham\u2019s diagrams show us, with nasty black bits on the graph, how our ancestors died of infectious diseases while we all get cancer. We get cancer, according to her, because we don\u2019t eat that fabulous mid-Victorian diet. The fact that cancer doesn\u2019t just affect burger-noshing cola-swilling slobs but also strikes down vegetarians and those who cultivate their allotments is an inconvenient truth which we shall ignore for now. If this is the crux of the matter, then is it the OLDER cohort: those in their forties to sixties, most at risk of cancer, who would be benefitting from all those splendid micronutrients? Or the youngsters?\n\nAs it happens, Rowbotham argues, as evidence for the rapid and tragic decline in dietary standards, that in 1883 the army had to reduce the minimum height requirement for recruits. Eh, what? In 1883? Ms Rowbotham, it may have escaped your notice, but the army also has a minimum AGE  requirement. Technically, \u201cboy soldiers\u201d could enlist, in extreme cases, as young as twelve to fourteen, but these were not normal recruits, who were expected to be seventeen. But even those boy soldiers had grown up during that period of Great Food, when people were so egregiously well-nourished. So why were the recruits allegedly so defectively short as soon as 1883? The reasoning doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nCut it any way you like, the effects of a tightly constrained period of Great Food, sandwiched between the malnutrition of the Hungry Forties and the decline of the 1880s is unlikely to be expressed in the statistics precisely within those dates. If the Great Food is so efficacious in preventing cancer, we should expect to see an increase in cancer rates in the late 19thC.\n\nDo we? And if we do, what does it tell us? The short answer is \u201cbugger all\u201d. The big change in mortality rates in the late 19th century is a decline in infectious disease. The big news over the whole century and a half is a decline in deaths from infectious disease. The main reason deaths from cancer form such a substantial block in that nasty graph is that deaths from infectious disease in the 2019 figures have shrunk to a vestigial trace. Even the \u201cdiseases of affluence\u201d which Rowbotham considers were largely restricted to the better-off, circulatory diseases and stroke, have shrunk away with modern medicine.\n\nhere is an editor of the very book cited, talking about cohorts, and making it very plain in his graphs that life expectancy was NOT as good in the 1860s as it is now\u2026https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/pp151184.pdf\n\nOn 19th century medical attitudes to cancer https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1449359/\n\nView on Patreon.

            "text": "I\u2019m struggling BAD rn...\n\n1.) I don\u2019t have a working phone (currently using my aunt\u2019s while she is asleep in order to access this, but I likely won\u2019t be able to access this post for the next few days)\n2.) I\u2019m unemployed because I have a young daughter and her dad doesn\u2019t do his share in regards to childcare.\n3) The small amount of money my child\u2019s father provides isn\u2019t enough to fulfill our basic necessities. My daughter is undernourished due to the lack of access to food. Her height is stunted and her weight is below the 10% for her age.\n3.) I have tried applying for food stamps on the little access I get to the internet. They are asking for tons of documents, but I don\u2019t have a working printer and I don\u2019t have anything with my current address on it, because I\u2019m such a nobody that I don\u2019t even receive mail. Plus, I\u2019m crashing in a relative\u2019s couch, so I don\u2019t even technically \u201clive\u201d here. I\u2019m not even on the lease. It\u2019s a temporary solution to a problem that has no end in sight.\n4.) My food stamps application keeps getting denied as a result of my inability to get to an office to provide those documents. I assume they have printers. Either way, I still won\u2019t be able to provide at least half of what the paperwork they\u2019re asking of me.\n5.) I struggle so much to get a job, even a minimum wage one. The general manager at the Denny\u2019s I used to work at said that I gave off a bad impression on my resume, because I\u2019d stayed less than a year at my other crappy restaurant jobs (the managers were so shitty, they made it near impossible to work with them, and the pay wasn\u2019t even enough to fulfill more than my food necessities. Forget being able to afford healthcare, or even housing.) Mind you, this Denny\u2019s literally hired por heads and felons, and the majority of applicants quit within the first week. I wasn\u2019t addicted to any substances, I was so desperate that I was literally willing to take ANY pay. I didn\u2019t even make minimum wage at that Denny\u2019s most days. I\u2019d make approximately $30 in tips (working my ASS off for at least 12 hours a day) and I made $2.16/hr.\n6.) I am currently suffering major home insecurity right now. Where I\u2019m staying here at my relative\u2019s, the other tenants are all adults and they dislike my child\u2019s childish ways. They are all closely related so I\u2019m the odd duck out. I\u2019m thinking about essentially stealing my relative\u2019s old useless car temporarily (until I find a job and get settled into a place) and returning it once I\u2019m done sleeping in it. I\u2019m honestly so, so fed up with life. I want to die most days. Nobody understands my pain. I hate myself, I feel inadequate. My own parents hate me. My family hates me, they see me as a burden they feel no responsibility with dealing with. I\u2019m made to feel that way on a daily basis. People who don\u2019t know me, know about my situation and criticize me harshly. I\u2019m not kidding when I say that NO ONE understands me.",

The [original](https://www.thepetitionsite.com/666/562/858/end-hunger-poverty-and-war-through-economic-innovation/) had a few links to support some of the claims.\n\nThis submission is an appeal to test scores. I didn't go to college, but in high school in the US, I scored a 1600 out of 1600 on the SAT in 2003 (top ~0.1%: [\\[1\\]](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-act-tests-test-preparation/1216542-number-of-perfect-sat-scores-by-year-since-1950s.html), [\\[2\\]](https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-got-perfect-scores-on-the-redesigned-SAT), [\\[3\\]](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/sat-act-tests-test-preparation/2402-how-many-people-get-1600-each-test.html)). I was also in Academic Decathlon two years and got first place in a bunch of categories that I don't remember (my team didn't advance to state competitions). I took 12 AP tests and scored 4s and 5s on all of them, including several that I didn't have classes for and at least one (environmental science) that I regrettably didn't even have time to study for, though I understand that now some people take over 20 AP tests.\n\nI joined the US military after failing to use the right date format on a college financial aid application and reading about US soldiers killing someone and dumping their body off a bridge, as I hoped to be able to prevent things like that. On the US military's entrance test, I got a 150 on the General Technical subscore, which was the highest my recruiter and instructors had ever seen. All my other subscores were higher than 150. At the time, my specialty, intelligence analyst, required a GT score of 105 (now it requires [Skilled Technical of 105](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab/asvab-and-army-jobs.html)).\n\nI can provide proof of these if needed, like a scan of my high school transcript or some military papers with my test scores (second would be hard to find though).\n\nI dislike an appeal to test scores or any other type of credentials, but I have tried everything else. Is it enough to get people to support this?\n\n____\n\nThe reason these problems exist is simple: we are socially rewarded for working long hours because it lets us say we are already helping other people and there is nothing more we can do.\n\nThis helps people we know, but hurts people we don't know since most of the problems of the world are due to a lack of money, which usually comes from paid work. We can change the social incentives to work more by affirming that we **don't have any problems** and **don't need any help**.\n\nBy sharing this proposal, you can tell your friends that you want to help the Third World by giving those people **jobs** and **knowledge**, even if it increases the cost of gasoline through higher demand.\n\nWe can do this by working less. Too much work is one of the most common regrets, yet the top 20% of households don't even spend a third of their income.\n\nTo fairly compensate for higher productivity when working less, businesses can give a higher wage rate when people do so on the condition they will work more when necessary. Example, 1.2x for the first 24 hours/week, 0.7x after that.\n\nWhen unemployment decreases this way, wages go up but there is no inflation because people still look at prices. The money is just taken from the profits of luxury goods sellers like Louis Vuitton, the financial market, and even Apple.\n\nThis gives jobs to people in poor countries by increasing the demand for cheap products, especially if their wealthy people also stop buying foreign luxury goods.\n\nNo starvation in Africa.\n\nNo more consumption for the sake of consumption.\n\nNo need for military spending or wars as a jobs program.",

The concepts make sense.\n\n>I dislike an appeal to test scores or any other type of credentials, but I have tried everything else. Is it enough to get people to support this?\n\n*Have* you tried everything else? There's something to be said about credentials and experience, but this may not be the best way to get people to support an initiative. In this case you're relying on appeal to credentials and experience to do almost all of the actual work, while your superior intelligence and experience are actually just *tools* that must be expertly used to do good work.\n\n`If I hurl my hammer at a nail from across the room, there's a slim chance something meaningful will occur. But, if I carefully and thoughtfully apply directed force to the head of a nail with the help of my hammer, that's where the magic begins. Everyone has a hammer, some hammers are just stronger.`\n\nIn this case, I'd suggest starting a nonprofit with the goal of creating jobs and implementing your employment model sometime in the future. Here's how you would get the process going:\n\n1. Identify a very  specific community that has needs.  **Keep it local.**\n2. Identify the *specific* ***community need*** that your nonprofit will work to solve (what, why, and how).\n3. Start your proof-of-concept phase while at the same time:\n\n* filing articles of incorporation with your state\n* applying for 501c ( ) status with the IRS\n* searching for your initial board members (3 is a good number)\n* thinking about revenue streams vs. expenses that work towards your mission",

            "text": "Hi, I am trying to write an article about people who are food insecure that attend D.C. panels/events open to the public and offering free food. The events they attend are typically hosted by think tanks, media organizations and/or associations -- something D.C. has plenty of. The people who frequent them are similar to what we saw from PanelCrasher circa 2013 ([http://panelcrashing.blogspot.com/](http://panelcrashing.blogspot.com/)), but instead being young and unexpectedly unemployed, they're older. In some cases they're seniors. These folks maybe have a costly medical situation that causes them to seek out anything free to supplement their food intake. Or maybe they haven't saved enough for retirement. They also might be too stigmatized to go to a food bank, or they may be in some denial about their downward mobility. Whatever the reason, they're clever enough to know there's plenty of food to find among \"polite society\" and are willing to sit for an hour or two listening to some expert(s) talk about nuclear disarmament or fiscal policy. I've personally seen at least a couple people myself go from one event to another, eating/pocketing free food. I suspect they were in this situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I can't imagine those who are doing this are particularly interested in talking about it. But I've also been told by someone who sets up media events that a very loose network of people in the city share information about these opportunities. I'm not sure if that's entirely true, but at the very least, I'm sure the people who do this know each other and have this common interest that brings them together. Have you seen this activity yourself? Know anyone who does this and who'd be willing to talk to me? Let me know. Any help would be appreciated.

It currently estimates that one person escapes extreme poverty every second \u2014 equivalent to 86,400 every day.\n\nIn 2016, measles was completely eradicated from the Americas.\n\nAccording to June 2017 figures, world internet usage now stands at 51 percent, up from 43 percent in 2015 and continuing the incredible growth rate since 2000, when only 7 percent of the global population was online.\n\nThe cost of starting a business in sub-Saharan Africa decreased dramatically from 300 percent of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita in 2003 to roughly 50 percent in 2016, a decrease of more than 80 percent.\n\nGlobal carbon dioxide emissions in 2016 were flat for a third straight year, despite the global economy growing 3.1 percent.\n\nSince 1990, 2.6 billion more people now have access to improved drinking water sources.\n\nThe number of underweight children under the age of five dropped from 160 million in 1990 to 93 million in 2015, despite the rise in global population.\n\nWomen made up a quarter of all parliamentary seats in 2016, a fourfold increase over the previous 20 years.\n\nIn more than half the countries measured in the World Bank\u2019s 2017 World Development Indicators report, the poorest 40 percent of the population experienced faster income growth than the national average between 2008 and 2013.\n\nFrom 1999-2012, primary school enrollment in sub-Saharan Africa rose by 75 percent, to 144 million children.\n\nAnd now, Q&A:\n\nHow much aid does the U.S. give to the world\u2019s poor?\n$30 billion goes to programs that assist the world\u2019s needy.\n\nHow does that compare to other foreign policy priorities?\n$663 billion goes toward military spending.\n\nWhy should the United States address poverty abroad when we have it here? \nThese are not competing interests. Our foreign policy should be focused on international poverty because it\u2019s the right thing to do and because it\u2019s in our strategic interest. And for the same reasons, our domestic policy should focus on poverty at home.\n\nDoesn\u2019t corruption in developing nations prevent aid from reaching the most impoverished people? \nWhile corruption exists nearly everywhere, including the United States, it is by no means a justification for ignoring the plight of the world\u2019s poor. In recent years, experts have developed numerous strategies for bypassing corruption and ensuring that the world\u2019s most vulnerable people receive assistance. The United States even set up a funding program that requires countries to address corruption before they can receive assistance. This ensures that aid coming from the United States goes directly to the people. \n\nWhat is the biggest hurdle in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and ending world hunger? \nLeadership from Congress and the White House. We\u2019re the first country in history that has the ability and political power to end world hunger. As the world\u2019s agenda-setter, the United States is in the unique position of leading the fight to reduce poverty and ensure that the Sustainable Development Goals are achieved, with help from other nations and the private sector.",

            "title": "Solution To ALL Major Problems on Earth",
            "text": "Solution To All Major Problems On Earth\n--\n...\n\nSimple\n--\nTattoo a BB-sized dot on the bottom of a woman's big toe at each delivery, and tie the tubes on the 3rd as part of standard hospital birthing policy.  No records, no loss of freedom/privacy, no additional authorities required.  A new standard for humanity, and a necessary one.\n\n\nEND of all Human Suffering\n--\nEND of unsustainable resource/environmental problems.  END of hunger/starvation.  END of banker/usury/economic problems (requirements of endless growth).  END of all wars (mass murder human disposal events).  END of abused/neglected children.  END of unemployment.  END of poverty.  END of homelessness.  END of the decreasing value placed on human life.  END of most serious crime.  END of most authorities and government; due to lower crime, social crisis, and other social costs.  END of all those that profit off human misery and suffering.\n\n\nOverpopulation\n--\nMost/all other mammals will not ovulate without an abundance of food in a stress-free environment; however, humans breed even when they are starving to death, and this factor has been the scourge of mankind since the dawn of civilization.  At least, we can find Plato writing that the cause of all war was the overpopulation of one valley causing invasions of other valleys for their resources.  And essentially nothing has changed since the time of Plato.\n\n\nIncreasing Benefits\n--\nCurrent population densities would very gradually decline to a steady-state where human life has much greater value and necessary life support; and the Earth, much greater abundance; in which case, 3 children is still enough to slowly increase population.  But at the currently devalued state of human life, 3 children/woman will probably lead to decreasing population densities over time.  Honestly, anyone saying they can provision a quality life for more than 3 children in the modern world at this time isn't responsible enough to have any children.\n\n\nEvasion\n--\nWhat if people try to evade this hospital policy?  Over time, this will be a non-issue: similar to brushing teeth, it's just something humans do for a good quality of life on Earth and the acceptance of others.\n\n\nHow To Implement\n--\nAllow entry visas from countries that enact this policy, and disallow visas from countries that don't.  Over time, it will become clear that this leads to a better quality of life for all.  Lead by a good example, and the rest will follow.\n\n\nNo Problem\n--\nNearly a third of American women rely on sterilization for contraception. Sterilization works by preventing an egg from meeting up with sperm.  All the techniques are highly effective, safe, and non-hormonal, so female cycles don't change.  There's a lot of Catholic propaganda on the issue, but it's just that: propaganda.\n\n\nSurgical Sterilization\n--\nThe doctor makes an incision just above the pubic hair and moves the tubes toward the incision to seal them; effective immediately.\n\n\nNon-Surgical Sterilization\n--\nThe tubes are blocked by the doctor placing a small coil of stainless steel inside, from the vaginal opening, and in about 3 months, a little scar forms that seals the tubes.\n\n\nBest Living Ever on Earth\n--\nTruly, this is the best thing mankind could ever do.  Life in a balanced state of harmony with the Earth.  Life would be mostly wonderful for all people everywhere throughout their lives, without the cycles of mass growth and death that usury exacts on mankind, and all of the other sufferings of human life.  The benefits to human life would be as near to \"Heaven on Earth\" as humanity can possibly experience.",

Any type of forced implementation of birth control will by default result in the increase of those who would cheat by breeding at a higher rate than others.  Then their offspring would have a higher tendency to cheat, etc.  Over time your evasion suggestion becomes completely moot.\n\nReally, the population problem can only be solved economically, and if you want to work towards a greater good, put your mind to figuring out how to successfully transition the global economy to a stable or decreasing population as the norm instead of being always based on increasing population.\n\nYou're trying to do a good thing here, but it comes across as very analytical, insensitive, and cold.

I stopped taking PPIs three years ago and replaced them with digestive enzymes, but now I'm worried about any permanent damage I might have done.  I'm not one for doctors, but is there anything specific I should have checked out by a qualified doctor or should I see a dietitian or something?  Any input would be appreciated.  Thanks.",

            "text": "My boyfriend has a lot of health issues, and its eating me alive to not know whats wrong. He is about 5'10\" and weighed about 125 when I met him. Now, 6 years later he weighs about 90-95 lbs and as happy and active as he tries to act, I know he's in a lot of pain. Im more looking for options to find out whats wrong being that he has no insurance, but I will add some details in case someone can help point us in the right direction. He tried going to a clinic but they didnt do shit, and I dont think the hospital will do anything since its not an emergency type situation. \n\nFor the details. He is 28 years old, and like I said is about 5'10\" and weighs about 95lbs. He has no appetite for the first couple hours after he gets up. He has really bad shoulder/upper back pain, which he thinks is from a back injury he incurred when he was 18 from falling off the roof onto a brick. He got no medical attention at the time for it. Now he cant do anything active, like skateboarding or even ride theme park rides, without being in extreme pain for a couple of days afterwards. The spot he says hurts feels like a hole in the muscle. He can eat non-stop but never gains weight. He's tried Boost and Ensure with meals to fatten himself up but he still cannot gain weight. I tried eating like him and I gained 20lbs! He is super skinny, and just looks overall malnutritioned. He gets really bad stomach pains, and swears he has an ulcer/ulcers. Although he enjoys eating some processed foods, he also eats tons of fruits and veggies. Even the nasty stuff like Okra and mustards greens. He grew up at his grandparents eating garden fresh food for most of his childhood. He said he was diagnosed with under-developed lungs as a child, and also had severe constipation as a child. He has severe sensitivity to sunlight, which he thought could be a sign that he inherited retinitis pigmatosa from his mom, but the eye doctor said he didnt see any signs in him. He never sweats, no matter how hot it is outside and no matter how active he is. Yet, in his sleep, he will sweat profusely. He also gets insomnia quite often, or only sleeps a few hours a night. \n\nNot sure if all of this, or any, is related, but thought it might help in finding the cheapest route for a diagnosis.\n\nI love him so much, and I hate to see him have such poor quality of life. Plus seeing him try to always stay so positive only makes it more heartbreaking to me. \n\nPlease Reddit, you're our only hope to getting some answers.\n\nOh yeah, he also grew up eating river fish, which I thought could possibly give him a parasite, and he was also tested for AIDS which came back negative. The clinic figured it was AIDS or he was lying about not being a cocaine addict which he is not. They pretty much gave up when they realized he had no money, and their initial assessment was wrong.\n\nCan someone please tell us where to go from here?",

            "text": "About a week ago, I broke a CFL, but at the time I had no idea about mercury contained within.  So I proceeded to clean up the mess without any special precaution.  I did not vacate the room right after the breakage, which I should have done in order to give some time for the air to ventilate.  I vacuumed, which supposedly breaks up the mercury into droplets for faster evaporation as well as facilitating its spreading throughout the room.  Finally, I had bedding/clothing right near the broken bulb that I simply dusted then proceeded to use as if nothing happened.  \n\nNow I've learned about the mercury and did extensive research on the internet.  While many sources say 5 mg of mercury inside a bulb does not pose a great risk, some sources do say that 5 mg is certainly enough to cause great harm under certain circumstances, perhaps ones like mine where I do everything I'm not supposed to do.  \n\nIn the past week, I've been experiencing many symptoms.  Tremor in arm and jaw, numbness and a couple of twitches in the left lower face, muscle weakness and fatigue in the entire body, slight headaches, and the list goes on.  Last night (day ~5 since exposure) I experienced asthma like breathlessness and difficulty breathing, something I've never had before.\n\nI've certainly experienced many symptoms of mercury poisoning, but the problem is that I cannot determine whether they might have been caused by other factors or not.  Around this period, I've not been eating well (1 or 2 meals a day).  I was also not wearing enough warm clothing in general, so my body was kept cold.  Also, I was sitting in front of a computer for long durations of time with a bad posture.  Perhaps the neurological symptoms (numbness, twitching, etc) may have been caused by the bad posture compressing the neck/back nerves?  Perhaps the tremors and pulmonary symptoms may have been caused by general body malnutrition and being cold?  I wish I could go to a doctor, but it is hard for me to arrange a visit due to some circumstances so it'd be best if I could first be absolutely certain of the need to do so.  \n\nSo my questions boil down to this:  based on my descriptions, does it sound like I may be suffering from acute mercury exposure?  When do symptoms of acute elemental mercury vapor exposure usually occur? (couple of minutes after exposure? hours after exposure? or couple days after exposure like in my case)  Would it be a good idea to wait out the symptoms with a corrected lifestyle removing other possible confounding causes?  Or instead should I head straight to a doctor (which as I stress again, is inconvenient for me to arrange in my current situation)?  \n\nTL:DR - Broke compact fluorescent lamp, may have inhaled mercury in there, experiencing many symptoms but cannot be sure if from pre-existing or due to other causes.

I was wondering if anyone would know why my elbow pulls this annoying and, in my profession, possibly dangerous, stunt almost every time I have to put something down without the use of my legs or back.  It only happens when my left arm is doing a [curl](http://imagine123.com/fitness/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/bicep-curl-exercise1.jpg) type motion. (Note: not me pictured)\n\nFor a little backstory, I am not aware of any injury that could have caused harm to the joint.  I first noticed it four years ago, and has not gotten any better or worse since then.  I am an appliance repairman but I also help with deliveries and installations, which requires using my arms to lift and lower 20-100 lb appliances, and the issue has given me a couple of close calls involving stairs and having the elbow lock up while trying to balance heavy air conditioning units.  When it does lock up, it is only painful enough for me to notice and lift again, then try to set the item down again.  Very rarely does it lock up twice in a row while trying to set one item down (without removing the weight from my arms). I am going to have it looked at by the end of the month, but I was wondering if anyone here had any suggestions, questions, or educated guesses of what could be causing my problem.\n\nThank you everyone who responds.",

In the early stages of ulcers, there are pains similar to hunger pangs. Typical gastritis can also present a hunger pang type feeling. \n\nEliminating any other issues, the simple question is that you're probably burning more calories than you have in the past. If that's not the case, it's your body's way of asking for more calories. It really is that simple. Again, as long as there are no other issues going on.\n\nAvoid sugary snacks or snacks of processed foods. Eat fruit or vegetables in between meals when you have time. Drink lots of water. The way to eliminate hunger pangs is to eat a small snack that's nutritious. Again...very simple. \n\nYour metabolism can change as you get older but that's not necessarily what's going on. And if you're eating two times per day, you're likely getting enough calories (in an American diet at least) to where you should be fine. It's not the ideal way to nourish your body but you certainly won't starve or have serious issues related to eating twice per day if both meals are full meals.\n\nPeople who are dieting get used to hunger pangs..it's a part of losing weight and it's not 'starving yourself' as so many people would suggest. It's the body going through a type of withdrawal of routine. Your body gets used to a certain amount of calories and meals. If you cut back on those, your body will let you know that it's ready for more, even if it's not a necessary component of health (excessive eating.)\n\n",

If it's physical, have you had bloodwork done to determine if you have any nutritional deficiencies that could be causing your body to crave food as a signal it needs essential vitamins or minerals?\n\nAlso, eating large amounts of food doesn't necessarily have to be bad, it just depends on WHAT you're actually eating, and if you're exercising enough to maintain an overall caloric deficit.

                    "comment_text": "Just because food doesn't have the same effects as hard drugs doesn't mean our brain isn't being affected by the food we eat in addiction like ways.  If someone said \"I can't go without at least one beer everyday\" or \"I'll quit drinking except when I'm watching sports\" we'd likely label them as an alcoholic, but if we replace the booze with food then we tend to call it moderation.  \"I'll clean up my diet but I have to have one dessert every day.\"  \"I'll quit eating poorly except when I'm watching sport.\"  In my perspective you have an addiction to food if you can't go indefinitely without whatever \"bad\" foods you eat that you know you shouldn't.  Addiction is a lack of control and if you don't have ultimate control over what you eat then you're a food addict.\n\nThere's no need to be hungry when cleaning up your diet though.  Instead of eating calorie dense, processed foods pig out on fruits and veggies.  So you don't have to work on suppressing your hunger...  Now most people have issues doing this because when they get hungry they want to eat bad foods and not the fruits and veggies.  That's a big sign of addiction in my opinion and if that's that case the problem isn't about dealing with hunger is about shifting your tastes to fruits and veggies.\n\nI do believe that we have to deal with hunger from time to time too.  Most people are under the impression that it's better to eat something than to not eat at all.  FALSE!  Our bodies were literally designed for periods of starvation to extend for many days.  Our bodies store enough glycogen for 2 - 3 days, nutrients for months, and fat for months of long term energy.  Skipping one meal isn't going to do a damn thing to you as long as you keep choosing to eat the right foods.  So if you're on a strict diet and traveling and there's nothing but burgers and pizza around, just don't eat...  \n\nThe body responds by conditioning and if you're used to fasting for 36 hours then dealing with hourly hunger becomes a breeze.  It's running a marathon then having to run a few blocks, pennies on the dollar, etc.\n\nI believe that intermittent fasting is the way to go to help deal with hunger.  I usually use 36 hour fasts once a week or so (I've gone up to 7 days on a water fast).  So the first thing you have to do is convince yourself your body has enough energy and nutrients that it doesn't need to eat every day.  When I fast I still workout doing hard sets (I went 4 days during my 7 day fast).  The second is to start training to fast.  Pick a day where you're going to fast consuming nothing but tea, black coffee, and water.  I'd see if you can go the full 36 hours and try to work it in once a week.  If you can't go the full 36 hours (bedtime to breakfast the next day) then start by fasting from bedtime to dinner.  Do that a few times then if you're comfortable increase it to bedtime to bedtime.  When you're comfortable with that go for the full 36.",

            "text": "I'm a 20 year old male college student.  Last semester (fall) was the first semester that I didn't have a meal plan, and because I wanted to save money and be healthy, I would cook basically all of my own food.  In addition, I was taking a bunch of engineering classes and doing extra-curricular activities, so I was super busy.  Also, I had been lifting weights for the past few years, so I eat a lot.\n\nAt the beginning, it was struggle to feed myself enough. I would find myself being hungry really often, and started eating at random times, but it seemed like I was able to feed myself enough.  Eventually, though, I lost my ability to feel hunger - I would never get any feeling in my stomach telling me I should eat.  And often when I wasn't sure whether or not I should eat, when I would eat a balanced normal-sized meal when I think I should (because I hadn't eaten much recently and was feeling a little low on energy), I would feel super tired afterwards (note that I was really disciplined with sleep, though, and always made sure to get enough).\n\nAfter last semester, during the holidays over winter break, I still had a hard time feeling hunger, but I was able to go back to normal energy levels.  One day during break, though, I had just finished eating a lot, and then my family decided to go to out to eat at a place that I like, so when we got there, I ordered a bunch of food.  Afterwards, my brain felt really cloudy, and I couldn't really think for the rest of the day.  I didn't really feel like eating anything the rest of the day either - or the day after.  And 2 days after, I made myself eat in the morning because despite not having any desire to eat at all, it didn't seem like a good idea to go without food for this long.  Eventually, after eating a little bit more each day, I was able to return to how much I normally eat.\n\nThis semester, I try to eat at normal times (and have a much lighter course load), but:\n1. I still don't have any ability to feel hunger.  I mostly eat when it seems like it's time to eat or when I have low energy and my brain gets foggy (and then the food usually tastes really good - but it's still strange and annoying that my body didn't make me feel hungry in the first place.)\n2. I still have low energy a lot of the time, despite roughly measuring the amount of calories I'm eating and trying to eat enough (and getting plenty of sleep).  It feels like my brain is deprived of glucose or whatever most of the time, but I'm not completely sure what to do about.  Even when I eat until I can feel that my stomach is physically feel, I still like I'm lacking energy.  I do feel pretty energetic at times, but I feel like I'm severely lacking mental energy way more often that normal.\n\nThis really bothers me because it's seriously hindering my ability to do well in school and work on my own personal projects.  Any advice, stories about your experience with something like this, etc. would be really appreciated.",

When the depression gets better, so does the hunger. \r\n\r\nFor the past few months, I've been following a paleo diet almost perfectly. I've been slacking on the running though, and the depression has gotten worse over the past few days, along with fatigue and hunger. \r\n\r\nThe appetite does not go away after I eat, which is the very strange part. No matter how much I eat, I want more right when I'm done. The stomach pain is usually what stops me from continuing, even though the hunger persists. \r\n\r\nI woke up at 7:30 and it is now 5 PM, and here is what I've eaten so far today, in order:\r\n\r\n* Three turkey burgers\r\n* Two eggs\r\n* Three potatoes\r\n* Bowl of oatmeal\r\n* Two bowls of brown rice\r\n* Five bananas\r\n* Half pound of baby carrots\r\n* Two more bananas\r\n* Mounds candy bar\r\n* Small bag of Lay's chips\r\n* Payday candy bar\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know any explanations that could help me, such as a link between exercise and decreased appetite? I've started Couch to 5k, which should hopefully help the depression and appetite, but I'm curious if anyone has any other ideas. Thanks!",

If that is the case with you, basically,  all you can do about it is learn some iron clad willpower.  Or, at least that's all I've found.   I count all of my calories every day.  When I've had all the calories I'm allowed, I just stop eating.  Trying to rely on feelings of hunger or fullness just doesn't work with me, so I don't.\n\nIt does get easier after the first couple of weeks.  I still have a hard time not thinking about food, but at least I don't have the painful,urgent MUST EAT NOW feeling constantly.    And when I'm exercising, I'm usually also in the right frame of mind to be more serious with myself about the food.  That does make it easier.    It's never really easy though.  I lost 120 pounds, but gained 30 back last year, just because I let the binging take over again.  I've gotten serious again though since the beginning of January, and I've managed not to binge all month!  It's possible to control, though it doesn't always seem like it.\n\nAnd of course, if that isn't the problem with you, totally disregard all of this.   ",

Some people can't eat anything, and some people eat all the time. The reason the 'hunger' doesn't go away, is because it isn't hunger. The compulsion you feel to eat is not because you're hungry, so getting full doesn't override it. It also makes sense that exercise would help, because it does alleviate the symptoms of depression to some extent. If you've been diagnosed with depression (I'm assuming as you said you'd tried medication before), my strong advice would be to see your doctor again and get some treatment for your depression. There are many. many options - medications (there are loads and they are all different so if you took something before and it didn't help you need to try something else), psychotherapy (like cognitive behavioural therapy etc, and loads of other things your doctor can tell you about. Please speak to someone qualified about this, it definitely has nothing to do with appetite or nutrient deficiency and can become quite debilitating if you don't do something about it.     ",

Plus I genuinely want to keep eating. \n\nBesides exercise, the tool that works best is brushing my teeth right after a meal. It seems to mentally signal an end to my appetite, at least temporarily. I think some of the residual hunger comes from latently tasting the food I just finished. So I brush to bust the binge.\n\nAnother thing that works well is to chew a lot more. You slow your intake, and you get more bang for your buck, since a bite in your mouth is generally capable of delivering a lot more taste than we milk it for when we scarf it down. I've noticed that getting the next shot of taste often happens only after I take the breath that I'd normally use to swallow a bite. Extra chews also give your stomach more time to feel full on less food, partly because it's easier to digest food already broken down by your teeth, so you get more nutrients from it. \n\nCuriously, for the last year or so, my tasters have started turning off when my stomach gets full.

            "text": "Background info: I'm a 27 year old computer programmer with an average weight. Currently my diet isn't the greatest, but I attempt to eat well. Typically get 6 to 8 hours of sleep a night. Normally drink one cup of coffee in the morning before work and smoke 7 - 10 cigarettes a day. I've been taking Adderall under a doctor's supervision for the past six months[first daily prescribed medication in my life] to treat adult ADHD, but the symptoms began occurring several years ago. When they began appearing, I started to change my lifestyle and habits gradually in order to deduce what the problem was. First I stopped drinking coffee at work during the day, then changed my diet to cut out any sort of excessive carbohydrates and sugar and included plenty of greens, fruits, and lean protein. Then after that still didn't work, I changed how I ate at work by eating 3 or 4 mini meals while working (ate an apple around 11, tuna salad with crackers at one, then a protein bar around 3). This helped, but still didn't elimanate the sleepiness. So I began excersizing for 20 - 30 minutes in the morning 4 days a week before work. This helped alot more, but still I felt an uncontrollable need to take a nap at work. Finally, and this is the only thing that eliminated the symptoms completely, I switched when I excersized to the evening and increased the duration to about an hour and half to two hours (running/biking, weight training, stretching). I enjoy excersizing alot, but the time it took to excersize each day so that I didn't want to sleep while working began affecting my personal life, hobbies, and relationships with friends and family. Recently, my lifestlye has slid a bit and no longer exercise as much as I used to. While at work, I get up every hour or two, stretch and walk around for a couple minutes and this helps also, but doesn't solve the problem. No history of depression (other than normal teenage angst when I was younger) but friends have mentioned I'm more anxious than the average person, but I don't believe it's enough for me to warrant seeing a doctor and is something I'm able to reason through. Normally a pretty well-adjusted and happy person and have a sense of purpose. Whew, that was alot of background, but just wanted to make sure I covered all the bases...\n\nSo, while at work I sit most of the day in front of a computer, programming. Typically eat a light lunch and snack all day on fruit or nuts (not an extreme amount of snacking, just enough to keep hunger from being a distraction) and maybe a granola or protein bar. But everyday around 2 or 3 pm, I get an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep. It's like my body is saying \"go the fuck to sleep\" but my mind is like \"you can't go to sleep now, you're working, stay awake!\". No matter how hard I attempt to stop it from happening, I wind up taking like micronaps which is a really strange sensation. I'll be in the middle of trying to solve a problem and all of a sudden I'll 'snap out of it' and realize I'd essentially been sleeping for maybe 2 seconds. I can sense when this is about to occur, I begin to really drowsy and eventually it devolves to the point of these micronaps that continue at pretty high frequency for the next hour or so. Finally I'll come out of that fog and still feel drowsy, but at least not \"micronapping\". I enjoy my work and am passionate about it, so I'm typically not bored while at work. Since beginning to take Adderall on a daily basis, the symptoms stopped occurring for maybe a month, but have only gone away once since starting the medication and that was when my doctor upped my dosage and the symptoms eventually came back.\n\nIt really is a pain in the ass and I don't know what to do, other than excersize 2 hours a day, which cuts into time I'd rather be practicing my instrument, hanging with friends, or reading. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Also, if anyone out there has experienced anything similar, if you would describe it and what steps you took to fix it, that would be awesome also. Thanks!",

            "text": "This started on Thursday.  I get hiccups when I clear my throat.  It has always happened, but the hiccups usually last about 5 minutes (pretty normal).  This time, however, they haven't stopped.  Apparently this is called persistent hiccups, which have several causes.  Here are some details about my situation, and maybe you can help me pinpoint the source.\n\n* When I get pretty hungry (growling stomach status), I get gassy and tend to burp.  So, apparently I get a gas buildup when my stomach is empty.\n* I started working out hard again for a few months now and eating less than usual, so this hunger occurs more frequently.  I also completed a week of a boot camp fitness course last week.  No I'm not starving myself, I am just eating lighter in general.  This may be causing imbalances in important chemicals in my body that are causing the hiccups.  Yes, I am drinking large amounts of water.\n* I *never* eat fast food, but on Wednesday night I thought \"What the hell\" and got a Jack-in-the-Box Spicy Chicken sandwich.  With all the intense working out I figured I need to get my carbs in as I am trying to bulk up more than the lean build that I have.  So, my body may be reacting to this type of food (bleh).\n* I tried several \"remedies\" so far, but they have failed.  I'm concerned that the cause of my hiccups are now not the usual causes.\n* Last night I came down with some heartburn, or possibly acid reflux.  After eating each bite of my sandwich, my chest would hurt for a moment a few seconds later.  I have only had heartburn twice since I can remember, so it's not normal for me to have it.\n* A TAD GRAPHIC: Yes, I tried the gag remedy.  I threw up and my vomit was very dark.  I'm not used to seeing red vomit, so I don't think it registered that it could have been blood.  My dad happened to ask me if I was throwing up blood, and it gave me an \"oh crap\" moment.  I may have have blood in my vomit.\n* This morning I was hiccupping the moment I woke up.  After a couple bites of cereal, the hiccups stopped for about an hour but have returned since.  I joined a friend for breakfast but had no troubling eating or swallowing (no heartburn or acid reflux).\n\nThose are details off the top of my head for now.  Please ask me any questions you feel are helpful.  I'm growing concerned, even after my dad asked me questions that sound similar to my problem.  Thanks for the help.\n\nPS - Yes, I am calling the doctor and setting up an appointment.  However, I would like to hear some experiences, or from people who specialize in [related areas].\n\n**Edit 01:** Another point added, possibly relevant.\n\n**Edit 02:  **UPDATE (5/30): Yesterday I got a few hiccup attacks (for a total of 4 days), but the intervals between were getting longer.  I took this as a good sign, and I believe the Prilosec OTC helped.  Today I haven't had any hiccups, except for a single one when I cleared my throat (as usual).  Right now it feels as if they can come back easily, I just need to avoid all possible triggers.  It looks as if they're fading away, so perhaps I had a case of acid reflux?  My follow-up questions are:\n\n1) I noticed my hiccups went away for a bit after eating breakfast (cereal & eggs).  Could the dairy have helped relieve the hiccups at all?\n\n2)  Additionally, is it possible that I have thrown off a chemical balance due to my heavier workout routine?  There has been mention of damage to the phrenic nerve.  Could I have done this during a workout, and is there any way I could have strained anything during my workout to cause this? ",

            "text": "*I feel like a bit of a jerk for making this my first post on Reddit, but I feel the need to ask*\n\nIf I don't eat for six or more hours, the next time that I eat I become extremely weak. This currently lasts for over 4 and a half hours. I have gone up to 24 hours without eating and experienced no ill effects (besides normal hunger), but within minutes of eating something, the weakness will hit. It is difficult for me to walk or open containers during this period of weakness- my movements seem to be in slow motion. \n\nWhat I eat doesn't seem to matter. I have tested with a single piece of beef jerky, a candy bar, bran flakes, yogurt, a tuna sandwich, and everything else I could think of- anything more substantial than water or gatorade seems to trigger the problem. I try to eat every 4 hours, to keep it from happening, but if I oversleep whatever I eat for breakfast will trigger it. This began in December of 2009, though the weakness only lasted about 1 hour to start. In late July/early August, it lasted about two and a half. The entire time, my blood sugar tests normal.\n\n\nPossibly useful information (**warning: possibly icky**)\n\n*I suffer from an undiagnosed stomach problem, which causes severe pain, GI bleeding, naseau, diziness, constipation/diahrrea, grey stool, black and tarry stool, watery stool,  sensitivity to touch, and cramping. Sometimes it makes me feel weak, but never to the extent of this other problem, so I am unsure if they are related. This begain in October of 2007. The only foods that seem to cause a problem are raw leafy greens and bananas. I take dicyclomine 20mg 4 times a day, tramadol 50 mg 3 times a day, and omeprazole 20 mg twice a day for this.\n\n*I have Depression/Anxiety disorder and mild OCD, for which I take 150mg of imiprmamine a night.\n\n*I have hypertension, for which I take 5mg of lisinopril every morning\n\n*I am also sensitive to sunlight. Spending time in direct sunlight makes me feel tired and sick, so I \nusually carry an umbrella with me. This runs in my mom's family.\n\n*Tests I have had: endoscopy and colonoscopy, allergy tests, dozens of blood tests, blood sugar monitoring, CT with contrast of the gallbladder, CT of the abdomen, ultrasounds, urine tests\n\n*Things doctors have ruled out: Crohn's, Celiac, wheat or gluten allergy, diabetes, hypoglycemia (five days of blood sugar monitoring, with a sample taken every five minutes, showed normal, even when weak), gallstones, kidney stones, lactose intolerance, potassium paralysis\n\n*I have tried a host of dietary plans, ranging from Atkins to vegan, and am currently eating 30-35 grams of fiber a day\n\n*I have also tried modifying/reducing/stopping my medications, both individually and all at once. This seemed to only make things worse.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what the heck is going on?\n\n**tl;dr** Breaking a fast of six or more hours causes me to be horribly weakened. It's not hypoglycemia.\n\n**Edit** Thanks to the people who have commented! \"Weakness\" is a bit vague, so here are some details about it: Normal movement, such as moving my arms around, becomes tiring. A sudden increase in gravity is the best approximation I've been able to come up with. Walking more than a couple hundred feet, in addition to being much slower than normal, is as tiring as walking a mile or more. Simply sitting and watching a movie or reading is, after two or three hours, exhausting, and I generally end up taking a nap or at least laying down.\nMy ability to push and/or lift is greatly reduced. Lifting a gallon of milk one handed is difficult, and occasionally requires two hands, and attempting to lift a 40 pound bag of dog food proved impossible, and resulted in sore arms for most of the day. A female friend, whom I can normally beat easily in arm wrestling (even if she cheats and uses both arms), is able to pin my arm, albeit with some effort involved. \nMy reflexes are slowed as well. The specifics vary slightly from day to day, but several tests (hitting the leg with a hammer in the stereotypical reflex test, during both normal and weak periods) reveal a noticeable delay and reduced response, from about half the normal \"kick\" to the leg barely twitching.\n",

                    "comment_text": "My guess is that this is a side-effect or a combined side-effect of the medicines you are taking. I would guess that you have seen a lot of specialists; I would recommend that you see a doctor who is skilled in diagnosing drug-interaction side effects, and ask this person what he thinks of your current meds and dosages. \n\nHowever, when trying to diagnose the undiagnosable, it's best to double-check that your life inputs on the macro level. People love to get lost in the fine details of whether there were trace amount of gluten in their rice crackers, but that investigative work is often unreliable.\n\nStart first with sleep. I dragged myself around for years not knowing that my situation and habits were preventing me from attaining \"deep\" (N3+N4) sleep at night. You need a sleep doctor AND an ENT specializing in sleep issues to determine this. A Zeo clock also helps. \n\nIn the short term, sleep is the most important input for well-being, even more than food, and perhaps water. You will not heal or feel well without \"deep\" sleep. In my case, the lack of deep sleep produced incredible fatigue and food allergies to nearly everything. But the condition was diagnosed as \"allergies\", not as I know now, the presence of sleep stress.\n\nSecondly, look at your food and water inputs. Not specific types of food, but its macronutrient makeup i.e. carbs, protein, fat. Make sure that is balanced. In the short term, the nutrient input matters less, but make sure to check whether you are consistently missing something. Your light intolerance could produce a Vitamin D deficiency for example. Also, consider Vitamin B deficiencies which might be creating anemia.\n\nTry to block off three or four days where you eat a balanced, and calorie-appropriate diet. Under-eating or overeating creates stress, and clearly your body has been accumulating stress for some time. Also include enough water.\n\nThe digestion of food pulls water out of your system temporarily. Although you may not feel thirsty, the first symptom of dehydration is weakness, not thirst. The process of digesting might be taxing your body's hydration.\n\nBlood sugar tests don't really help diagnose anything but diabetes or hypoglycemia. \n\nIn the longer term, consider the impacts of your mind or emotional situation. Considering yourself to be a sick person is a stress in of itself; it colors everything you perceive. \n\nEven if your mind is right, your life situation may be wrong. Maybe your activities are producing an adverse result. When I worked outside all day, I couldn't wait for the time in my life where I could work inside all day. When I started working at a desk more, my weight ballooned and it took a long time to start working it back down.\n\nIf you are rested properly (and that's key), beneficial diurnal activities are very important for preserving well-being. The most important activities aren't aerobic or anerobic, etc. The most important activities involve a full range of motion of every joint, repeatedly. That's why yoga and tai chi are so effective. If you're fatigued, pursue a course of range of motion exercises first. You need to explore the farthest extent of the bends and moves your body is capable of, over time. This is not stretching, btw. Look up the Egoscue method.\n\nIf your macro inputs are well controlled, your body should eventually heal from fatigue stress. In some cases, like sleep apnea stress, you won't be able to control them without external assistance. \n\nDon't take anything I say as just another recommendation that you need more will power and virtuous habits. In my case, virtuous habits had nothing to do with it. A major part of what I was dealing with was an obstructed airway while I was sleeping, thus fatiguing me all night. It wasn't a will power issue. Even a better mattress helped! It's a critical health input.\n\nRigorously check all your macro lifestyle inputs. Investigate, and make sure that everything is sufficient. I firmly believed that I was a normal person capable of normal health, and persisted until I found some macro inputs which were adverse for me. You cannot take anything for granted. Challenge everything about your habits. Know what your habits are, e.g. when you go to bed, when you drink, what tv you watch. Ask if any of them could contribute in any way to general stress. Even tracking politics on tv or the internet might be a stress that you should stay away from.\n\nIn sum, you've looked at a lot of specifics, even your grams of fiber per day. But the body is adaptable and resilient if the macro inputs are correct. Specifically check your sleep, even if you think you're getting enough. Have your airway checked by an ENT specializing in sleep issues. \n\nHealth is often the result of positive choices, not choices to avoid things. It's often hard to do it all on your own, so lifestyle adjustments may be required to find the social support you need to accomplish this overhaul.",

            "text": "Hi r/Health,\n\nI started college this fall and as a result have been choosing my own food intake (mostly ate at home until I moved into college, parents picked what went in the pantry). Since starting college, I've begun to feel ill if I consume much dairy product.\n\nI can handle small amounts fine- mug o cocoa, a little bottle of milk, some ice cream, a little cheese on top a sub or some pizza, doesn't bother me. But it seems that if I eat more than that, I feel somewhat bloated, my stomach \"gurgles\" (but not a hunger pang, because I'm no longer hungry), and I tend to experience diahrrea within a half hour or so. Foods that can set this off are: too much milk (a pint, I think? Food merchants here sell small bottles of milk, two can do it to me), chicken quesadilla (which I eat with sour cream- more dairy) and omlette with cheese (shredded and sprinkled on top). Breakfast wraps, which contain some cheese, can also make me feel slightly queasy but don't trigger the whole reaction described above.\n\nAs far as I have noticed, no other type of food product makes me ill, and the products do not all come from the same merchant. (Cannot say for certaint if merchants' supplies come from the same company though.)\n\nThoughts/advice? I do plan to ask my doctor next time I have an appointment, though it's not so serious a problem I intend to schedule an appointment just for this.\n\nThanks!",

            "text": "So lately (the past month or more) I've been having some pretty unhealthy habits. I don't really eat enough at all and I don't sleep enough at all. I'm 18, and I usually fall asleep at 3:00-3:30 AM, wake up at 6, don't eat breakfast, go to school, eat maybe an apple and a tiny bit of a sandwhich for lunch, go home, eat maybe a banana, and then eat dinner. I also only drink about 3 glasses of anything a day and it's usually tea. I feel like this isn't normal, especially because I'm starting to get bad headaches and I have trouble waking up. I feel sluggish and like I can't move, but at the same time I'm just not that hungry. I just feel completely exhausted I guess. I thought it might be anxiety that was making me lose my appetite, but after talking to my psychology teacher, he said he thought I was probably one of the least stressed and anxious people in the class. I don't really feel stressed, but I don't really feel happy either. Or sad. I just don't really feel anything right now. I just wake up, go to school, go home, then sleep for a tiny bit. So is this something I should be concerned about? If so, who should I go to for help?",

My anxiety can kill my appetite so instead of feeling hungry I feel dizzy or my blood sugar drops and I get all sweaty, shaky n panicky. \n\nYou should be concerned you can go on eating little and missing out on sleep forever without getting very ill.\n\nCan you make an effort to eat more? In order to trigger the hunger sensation you're going to have to force yourself to eat more. Eventually you should start feeling more hunger and should be able to eat much more food.\n\nGo to the doctor to make sure it's not a medical issue. ",

It's thought that fiber helps slow down the absorption process so you don't get that instant injection and fat conversion.\n\nOur bodies absolutely are designed to handle sugar. Why else do we like sweet things? The problem is that the soda and candy bars inject sugar into our bodies in ways it doesn't handle well. But some fruits are probably better than others.\n\nAs for the best snack it's \"Whatever works for you\". Lately I've been on a popcorn kick for my snacking when I want something grainy. I also snack on dry cheerios but I've eaten them most of my life and I try not to overdo it. But eating them keeps me away from worse snacks.\n\nFor sweets I prefer fruits, but they don't store so well so I also keep around other sweets that I only like in very small doses. 1-2 small hard candies at night to curb a sweet tooth isn't going to do me any harm, especially if it keeps me from drinking a soda or grabbing a snickers. But I absolutely avoid buying certain things I just can't stop eating(starbursts and red licorice). Though I might switch to sugar free hard candies, but I don't think eating a lot of those are any better for you.\n\nBut you really need to tailor your diet for yourself. Don't deny yourself everything, just aim towards the healthy. You'll be on this diet the rest of your life. What's the point of being alive if you can't enjoy the odd pleasure now and then.\n",

            "text": "First, I was sick with the flu like everyone else in the house I was living in. But my symptoms were different and stayed when everyone else got better. I felt sick (major abdominal cramping, overheating/feeling warm to the touch to other people, shaking uncontrolably, very dizzy and light headed, general disorientation, upset bowels, excessive yawning). This lasted, fairly consistently, for at least 4 days. I tried to eat bread and even bread made me feel I'll. Drinking water too. I got severely dehydrated about a week into it. I decided to start drinking more water. \nI felt a bit better (somewhat less dizzy, etc.). I tried to stay hydrated after that. Eating anything, especially large amounts at one time, made me feel what I call an \"episode\" (the symptoms described above). \n\n\nAs time passes I have fewer episodes. I am often so overheated and in pain that I lay down, curl up, and pass out (I don't lose consciousness, just go to sleep, feel mostly better afterward - at least mostly relieved of the pain). My appetite is killed each time I have one of these episodes.\n\nFoods: I avoid beef, tomato (yes, even pizza), spicy food, and anything that is obviously processed because those types of foods have seemingly given me \"episodes.\" I avoid dairy for the most part because 1.) I could be intolerant of dairy or 2.) it could bind me up, causing pain. I ate mostly bread and eggs for the fist few months (and still do every morning).  Eggs do not bother me and neither does bread (so not a glutton problem?). Foods that cause gas irritate my bowels A LOT so I try to be easy on them (although I know I should be taking in a lot of fiber so I do eat them). Anything that has a large amount of probiotics (yogurt, Kombucha, etc.) seems to make my stomach and bowels upset. \n\nTMI -- These days when it comes to my stool, it is usually loose (but not liquid) and although I eat often (not a lot but often, approximately 2/3 of my normal caloric intake according to my size), I only pass food about every other day and not much when I do. There has not been any blood in my stool that I know of. The only stomach pains have been hunger for the most part (excepting when I've eaten acidic foods such as tomato soup or onions). [Major TMI -- I haven't menstruated since I've been sick, 5-6 months now -- Have had pregnancy tests, negative ... obviously]\n\nMy episodes have become fewer and far between. I seem to not yawn nearly as much. Though, I've been noticing lately that when I have to use the bathroom (#2) I often have a slight reaction like an episode (a bit overheated, cramps, dizziness, disoriented). I have an episode about once every 3 weeks now. Afterwards, I lose my appetite. \n\nAs of the first week in October I was diagnosed with a kidney infection and had to take Macrobid, an antibiotic (this could explain my loose bowel movements lately although I had no diarrhea while taking the medication -- it does kill \"good\" bacteria as well as bad though). \n\nI just had my blood tested and a lower and upper ultra sound taken ... they showed nothing. Although these may not show any bowel issues. Perhaps a stool sample is next (or a probe ... ick). \n\n----\n\nPrevious injuries/illness: \nLast Winter I had an IUD (birth control) put in and I passed out, hit my head on the floor and had a seizure. I had the device immediately taken out. It is not a surgical procedure.\nIn April I fell while snowboarding for the first time, hitting my tail bone pretty hard. I may have damaged it, never had it checked out. It still bothers me to sit for too long or sit in certain positions (sharp pain in that area). \nA few weeks before I became ill with whatever this is - James and I had some frozen fish fillets that were somehow compromised -- they made us VERY sick, although we did not vomit, we hallucinated, overheated, and had trouble urinating for a few days (kidney pain). We both recovered well within a day or so. \nI had also had raw fish in the form of sushi in the months preceding my illness.  \n\n----\n\nWhat I don't think it is: \nChrones -- no blood in my stool, no needing to use the bathroom immediately (during a meal, etc.). \nPeptic Ulcer -- my stomach is fine, although ulcers can be below the stomach (the 1st ER doctor, Franklin Memorial, suggested this: antacids -- which do nothing but bother my intestines).\nHyperThyroid -- although I've lost a lot of weight, my current doctor says this is most likely not the issue. \nB12 Deficiency -- blood was tested, nothing found. My current Doctor said this is what she suspected. \nAppendicitis -- 6 months, acute reactions, no overall pain enduring, does not hurt to push on appendix or area. \nTwisted Intestine -- No sustained pain in the intestines.\n\nWhat I think it COULD be:\nParasite \nBowel Issue \n\nUpdate: my doc recently found H. Pylori in my stomach (the 3 medications were initially $470 before asking for the generic brands). I have not taken these yet, my wedding is in exactly a week and I'll be damned if I'm going to be on 3 strange meds and running to the bathroom during the ceremony. I also highly doubt H. Pylori is my REAL issue. I have NO stomach pain or nausea or vomitting nor do I have blood in my stool. \n\nI see the doctor tomorrow to ask her if she really thinks the H. Pylori is causing my issues. Also, my kidney pain is back but keeping well hydrated makes it a minor pain (worse in the morning when I've gone hours without water or urinating).\n\nThank you so much for caring enough to read this! I've been sick for far too long. I want my life back!\n\nEDIT: My doctor found H. Pylori in my test results. I'm being treated for it now. ",

            "text": "I started noticing symptoms maybe a month or two ago. It started just with having a sort of high resting heart rate; doctors would always ask me if I was nervous around them (which I wasn't) when they checked my BP. \n\nAfter a while I just couldn't sleep at all (I have had issues with insomnia, but that is mostly due to pain and discomfort; now I wasn't even able to get tired.). And I couldn't eat at all either, even if I tried to force myself. Probably related to that, on some mornings or nights I've been throwing up mucus.\n\nOver the past 2 months or so, I've lost 30+ pounds. I have not been exercising nor have I been trying to lose weight.\n\nIt got really bad a couple of weeks ago where my blood pressure started to shoot up to 220 and my resting heart rate would be 175+. I couldn't think clearly, and was shaking uncontrollably. I had EMTs come and was sent to the ER three times that week.\n\nDuring that week, I had a 24 hour holter monitor, but my cardiologist and internist both said different things about the results. I didn't feel like I had an episode when I was wearing the monitor, but they still saw that consistently my heart would be going 160bpm. One of them had said that those peaks went away when I was asleep though, and the other said it was still spiking in the middle of the night.\n\nI'm currently taking metoprolol (beta blocker) to prevent my heart and bp from rising to those dangerous levels again, but that's only really treating a symptom. Things have been much better since I started taking that, but I still get a lot of the other symptoms (like chest pain and shakiness). And since I started taking the beta blocker I've at least been able to get tired again, and if I force myself I can eat. I still haven't received legitimate 'hunger signals' in what seems like weeks.\n\nMy mom had hyperthyroidism, so that was one of the first things we checked for. Thyroid was normal. Also did both blood and a 24/hr urine test for catecholamines (checking for pheochromocytoma) and they came back within normal range.\n\nI also had a CT done of the abdomen and pelvis, but only found issues related to my bone tumor/hip surgery; I will be following up with an orthopedic oncologist for this.\n\nI'm supposed to see a new cardiologist specialist pretty soon to get a 2 week holter.\n\nSorry I'm kinda all over the place here and I think I may have left out some symptoms. The chest pain I get is sort of like a pulsating squeeze of pressure and every now and then it gets sharp. When it is really bad I will feel it in my left shoulder blade and arm. I also have a mass on my left testical that sometimes gets painful, but my urologist said he thought it was an epididymal cyst. \n\n**Medical Background**\n\n* 20 (21 in a few days)\n* Male\n* Current weight: ~160lbs (Previous ~195lbs)\n* Family history of cancer\n* I had a rare type of bone tumor in my hip at age 14; treated with cryosurgery; passed 5 year mark last year.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions?\n ",

            "text": "Since this January, my 15-year-old sister has had stomach problems. Every time she eats (no matter how much or what kind of food she eats), her stomach begins hurting. She describes it as a sort of bloated feeling. For a while, she tried to ignore it, hoping it would go away, but... well, it hasn't. She's lost 20 pounds, it's getting worse, and nothing we've tried to stop it has helped much or at all.\n\nShe has no other symptoms. No vomiting, diarrhea, or anything like that. Just the stomach pain.\n\nMy parents have taken her to a specialist, and a gastroendoscopy has been performed. The specialist gave her a prescription for Omeprazole, which didn't help much (although apparently her symptoms are worse when she doesn't take it). She's going to another specialist soon. She's been diagnosed with \"acute gastroenteritis,\" which is broad, uninformative, and doesn't really offer treatment options.\n\nAll of this was bearable during summer, since she could mostly ignore it and remain mostly stationary. Now that the school year has started, though, she's in trouble. The pain is distracting her from her classes and the hunger isn't much fun for her either. My parents are considering finding some way to homeschool her or looking for other options, but obviously that would be a last resort.\n\nSo... frankly, I'm terrified for her. She's still functional, but she's having a lot of trouble and I hate seeing her like this. My family is getting desperate.\n\nDoes anybody have suggestions, ideas, or related situations? I know it's a bit of a long shot, but we're looking for any fragments of information we can find at this point.",

Most sufferers have nausea and bloating as prominent symptoms, but at least 20% of persons with this condition have pain as the main symptom - the pain is typically in the upper abdomen and gets worse after eating. It can be diagnosed with a nuclear medicine gastric emptying study - a 4 hour test using a \"standard meal\" is best (some radiologists do a shorter test which is not as accurate).  \n\n(2) chronic idiopathic small duct pancreatitis. this condition can cause upper abdominal pain after eating, and may be very difficult to diagnose -- sometimes CT scans of the pancreas or an MRCP (mri of the pancreas) are normal, and even an endoscopic ultrasound (sonar taken using a special endoscope) can be unremarkable. This condition can be recognized by performing a secretin stimulated pancreatic function test if the 3 noted tests are unremarkable (but this is not done very many places in the US). \n\nThere are other conditions that can cause upper abdominal pain after eating (\"functional dyspepsia\" is a wastebasket term used when the doc can't find the real cause so blames it on psychological issues) (sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is a rare condition where the sphincter that controls emptying of the bile and pancreatic ducts into the duodenum does not work properly) (gallstones or sludge in the gallbladder can cause pain in the upper abdomen or the right upper quadrant after eating meals, especially containing fat - this is generally detected with a sonar, but sludge in the gallbladder sometimes has to be found with a nuclear medicine gallbladder ejection fraction test).  \n\nThese are just some ideas, none of which may apply to your sister, but good luck!\n",

After class I grab a sandwich or burger, and then I try to come up with a decent dinner at home. \n\nI hardly ever finish a meal, and it seems like the less I can make myself eat, the less I want to eat. Half the time I wish I could get through my day without eating at all, because I'm miserably hungry/nauseated before I eat, and uncomfortably full right afterward, then I swing back into uncomfortable hunger. \n\nSometimes I'll go through phases where it's not really an issue, then I'll spend a few weeks like this.

I started because it was the first diet/healthy eating plan that I thought I might be able to follow. I'm still working out the kinks. I find it fairly easy to postpone \"breakfast\" until mid-afternoon. Still working out the evenings, though -- I don't want to eat the rest of the daily calories right before bed, but I'm too hungry to sleep unless I save enough calories for a bedtime snack (banana, glass of milk, half an English muffin). The next day, I never really feel as if I'm full, despite eating normally (but despite not feeling full, I don't find myself overeating). Because of this rebound feeling, I think it's best to have more than one normal day in between fast days.\n\nAside from the stomach growls, the hardest part of this for me is planning -- you have to make sure your 500/600 calories count, nutritionally. The plus side is that prepping for the two fast days is making me do more meal planning in general. I do have to watch myself in the grocery store -- part of my brain thinks, \"Since you can eat whatever you want today, buy a big bag of Oreos!\" But the point is to eat normally on non-fast days, not to binge.\n\nPros: Not having to count calories every day; being able to fast on whichever days are most convenient for me; developing greater general awareness of the nutrition and caloric content of what I eat; learning how food affects my body.\n\nCons: So far I haven't gotten that rush of clarity and energy some people say they get when fasting--I can function fine at work, but I'm never not aware of uncomfortable hunger. Also, staying hydrated without eating means peeing a LOT. \n\nI'm hoping my body adapts to situation as I continue and as I normalize my messed-up sleep patterns. ",

Generally able to carry on with life but avoided certain long lectures and eating during the day if possible.  \n \n\n>When nausea and acid \u201cattack\u201d would onset, generally after 10 minutes or so they would subside (see more below about this)  \n \n>Currently day to day symptoms:\nNausea in mornings, instantly from when I wake up. Accompanied by acid-like (burning) feeling in stomach. Also lots of wind first thing in the morning, accompanied by an extreme feeling of trapped wind and/or feeling bloated. Bloated feeling occasionally relieved by passing wind, however usually returns to feeling bloated shortly after. Nausea usually subsides when I become very hungry around 10/10:30am. After eating it usually returns with all symptoms other than wind. Quite common to have looser than normal bowl movements in the mornings.  \n \n\n>As lunchtime arrives feeling subside and replaced by hunger, however light-headedness remains fairly constant. After eating at lunch symptoms usually onset into the afternoon. Some days I can feel a bit bloated and relatively okay, somedays I feel incredibly nauseous going into the afternoon.  \n \n\n>As the evening progresses I generally start to feel better and usually can eat an evening meal without symptoms or very brief symptoms. Bowls are usually regular by now. As I go to bed I usually have wind, with the feeling of trapped wind and/or bloatedness.  \n \n\n>Occasionally recently I have awoken in the night (or sometimes onsets shortly after I\u2019m in bed and before sleep) feeling incredibly nauseous, sweating and with strong acidic feeling in stomach. Has caused me to rush to the toilet anticipating vomiting but have not vomited to date.   \n \n\n>When symptoms are worse:\nIf I drink coffee (Have cut out fully from diet as a consequence) \nIf I eat late at night (makes the next morning worse or occasionally waking up in the night as above)\nAfter eating\nIn stressful situations  \n \n\n>\u201cAttacks\u201d:\nQuite commonly I will have what I can an \u201cattack\u201d \u2013 these can happen in various intensities and isn\u2019t uncommon to have one a day.\nDuring these attacks the feeling of acidity onsets accompanied by nausea. I will feel lightheaded too. Depending how bad the nausea gets I can start to sweat and have a hot flush, and I get very restless. These can range to just feeling slightly bloated and light nausea to like I am about to vomit at any moment. My mouth generally goes dry and I become thirsty, however most times the feeling of nausea prevents me drinking. Also generally feel I need to pass stool (sometimes not, or not possible)  \n \n\n>I have developed an anxiety to being in social situations whereby there is pressure to not be feeling sick or vomiting. However I am fairly certain if I managed to find the cause of the general sickness feeling then the anxiety towards it would pass also and I wouldn\u2019t suffer from these attacks. My mind has almost created a self-harming circle whereby I feel slightly ill so it convinces itself I feel more sick. Generally I do not suffer from any social anxiety or anxiety as a whole \u2013 the only anxiety I suffer is to do with having an attack as in the past attacks have onset and made me feel terrible.  \n \n\n>Examples of places I will suffer from an attack or onset of symptoms:\nLectures (Worse with more people), meetings, plane/bus journeys (am not afraid of either transportation), in quiet situations with other people around (ex: waiting in a doctors surgery for appointment), situations with new/lots of people (ex: a meal with lots of people) \u2013 it\u2019s worth bearing in mind these are examples of the type of situation, not a hard fast rule for that exact situation.  \n \n\n>It\u2019s also worth noting I don\u2019t always get an attack in the above situations, I can sometimes go without incident.  \n \n\n>Recently I have had two attacks whereby the nausea was so great I had to leave and go home. The first was getting ready to go out with a few close friends (May have been related to my ear issue few months ago) and the 2nd was with my girlfriend when we went out with her mates (who I don\u2019t know as well) and arrived at a very busy pub. Within about 20 minutes I was feeling too nauseous to drink and had to leave after an hour. \nDuring these episodes I often feel the need to go to the toilet and it\u2019s usually quite loose, however I don\u2019t always need to (or have the choice to) go. Passing stool sometimes can help relieve the nausea.  \n\n\n>When the episodes pass the feeling of acidity almost \u201ccools\u201d down and feels like it has moved through my stomach, the nausea stops along with this and I cool back down. Generally I am okay for the rest of the day once it has passed and can eat & drink normally.\nThings that help the symptoms:\nPeppermint tea tends to help\nA drink of water can help (sometimes)\nDrinking a beer before & during a meal seems to help keep symptoms at bay\nGaviscon/Renne & boots wind reliever seems to help. They seem to create a \u201ccooling\u201d sensation and acid & nausea fade. Effectiveness seems to lessen sometimes, to having no effect during a bad attack/episode. Wind reliever seems to help the wind at night and lessen the feeling of trapped wind and being bloated in the mornings. Occasionally these tablets seem to add to the nausea briefly if taken in the morning with little food in me.  \n \n\n>Why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s IBS:\nNo abdominal cramping/pain\nNo trigger from certain foods \nNo symptomless periods \u2013 maybe one or two days feeling slightly better but no longer.\nNo persistent amounts of diarrhoea \u2013 only after/during bad episodes/attacks/mornings\nConstant nausea \u2013 not just during bad flares as with IBS sufferers. \nNo common IBS medicine seems to have effect (Mebeverine, colpermin, buscopan, etc)\n>Feeling of acidity in stomach present  \n\n  \n\nAny help or inside is GREATLY appreciated.  \n\nEDIT: Formatting (which apparently hasn't work anyway.)",

I wouldn't even know how to describe my symptoms to a doctor.\n\nOn any given day, it can be a variety of things: burning sensations on different parts of my abdomin, either before or after eating, random gurgles either all over different regions of my stomach, or particularly just behind my right lower ribs, a bit of an unusual 'hunger' feeling if I haven't eaten for a while (hard to even describe but I 'feel' like my stomach has a lot of acid in it) pain/tightness to the left and right sides of my upper chest after eating a large meal sometimes, and random extreme bouts of gas where I swear I can feel the gas moving around in my intestines. Sometimes, my skin will even prickle/burn in random areas for a time that aren't even my stomach, though that's semi rare. \n\nThankfully, I don't usually have problems with my stool, except that it's hardly regular. I feel like I've been going only once or twice a week.\n\nAnd now, for some strange reason, I feel oddly really 'tired' in my head and I have a headache after a day of another randomly burning stomach.\n\nAll this goes on and off and seems to change to occurring before I eat or after I eat, and what I do with my diet.

            "text": "Exhausted for a Week after Very Moderate Activity (Shopping \u00bd day)\n\nMy stats: Male, 40 years old, ~180 pounds, 5 foot 7 inches tall (I\u2019m about 25 pounds overweight), employment is desk job in a cubicle. Chronic health problems: generalized anxiety disorder, take 30 mg Buspar (anti-anxiety medication) per day as treatment.\n\nSo I went shopping last Saturday for half a day. I admit that I might have walked a little longer than I was used too. In addition, I probably ate a little less food than I normally do. I did get a little hungry before I bought some food, but eventually I did satisfy my hunger by the end of the day. Also, because I was trying to lose a little weight, I might have eaten a little less food each day for about 3 or 4 days previously. I always did eventually satisfy my hunger by the end of the day.\n\nBy the time I got home that afternoon I was very tired and sat down for the rest of the day. The next day, Sunday, I felt incredibly weak all day. My muscle strength was perhaps 50% of what it normally would be. I sat down all day Sunday. Monday I was still very weak but pushed through my work day (remember, I have a desk job). I normally take the stairs up to my cubicle at my workplace, but by the end of the day my legs were very sore from taking the same stairs I always take. Tuesday I was so tired that I took a sick day from work, I basically stayed in bed all day. Wednesday and Thursday I went to work, took the elevator to my cubicle, and felt progressively better. Friday I decided to walk up the stairs to my cubicle, and I was wiped-out energetically by the stair-climbing effort the entire day. Today, Saturday, I plan to spend all day in my bedroom trying to recover.\n\nI do not appear to be sick. I do not have any symptoms of cold or flu.\n\nHere is what is really unusual. This kind of thing happens to me all the time, maybe 3 or 4 times a year. Sometime I recover my energy in a week, and sometimes it takes a full month to recover. I recover with bed rest, eating lots of food, drinking lots of water, and careful increases in my activity level. I have been having this problem for more than 10 years and it has had a significant negative impact in my life.\n\nThe extreme fatigue is usually triggered by a little more exercise than usual or a little less food than usual. Then my muscles get extremely weak and I spend a lot of time sitting down and laying down. I also feel these troubling waves of discomfort (I believe these sensations are my body urging me to rest) throughout my body during and after exercise.\n\nI have been to the doctor about this fatigue, and the various tests have always come out negative. Tests I have had include electrolyte balance, electrocardiogram, mononucleosis, and hepatitis.\n\nDoes anyone have any guesses about what is going on?\n\n \n\n**Edit:**\n\n  1) I did have a short episode of depression earlier this year, though I think the depression has resolved itself. The way I feel now is different from what I felt when I had depression.\n\n  2) I am aware that I may have hypochondria. In the past I have complained about many ailments to my doctor that have turned out to be imaginary, for example: a torn ACL, a bellybutton hernia. ",

            "text": "I am a 17/yo female. About late august last year (9 months ago), I started having extreme intestinal cramping, especially when I have to have a bowel movement.\n\nI'll know I need to book it to the nearest washroom when I have a sudden and very intense onset of painful cramping and I will have an accident if I'm not on a toilet in 20 seconds max. I used to have normal bowel movement every 1 and a half days and now I'll be lucky if I can keep the bathroom trips down to three per day.\n\nThe pain, cramping and uncontrollable bowels have remained relatively the same throughout this whole time except the bowel movements themselves often change. For the first four months they were mostly entirely liquid, now they are solid but very soft, sometimes not formed, thin and they sink to the bottom quickly. Also there is quite a bit of mucus which has been there from the beginning. \n\nAlso, my intestines make literal gut-wrenching movements. It's not like anything I've ever experienced before. It's far more intense and different than simple stomach rumbling from hunger. This is literal twisting, even popping sensations and strong trembling.\n\nThe family doctor's first guess was IBS which is what this sounds like, so he prescribed me Dicetel. It did absolutely nothing whatsoever. He then considered a bacterial infection, to which he prescribed me Metronidazole, which again served no relief. He then put me on Buscopan and *Clonazepam*. To no surprise these also did nothing. \n\nSo after the first blood and stool test, my family doctor said he would refer me to a specialist for some imaging. He actually sent me to a fucking *pediatrician*. So I have been going to this pediatrician \"specialist\" for several months now and he hasn't helped me at all. I visit him every other week and each time I see him, he just insists that I stay on his fibre-only diet and take laxatives. His theory is that I just have a buildup of waste sitting in my colon and he wants to flush it out. He's put me on Pico-Salax three times and I've been following his orders and all that has happened is the symptoms have gotten even worse. I'm fairly certain that this is not diet related because I have tried every type of elimination diet (Gluten, dairy, sugar, etc) and my intestines still cause me severe pain. I've had 3 blood tests done, 3 stool samples taken, everything came back normal. No UC, no Chron's, no Celiac, normal thyroid levels, no parasites or bacteria, etc. According to Western medicine I am perfectly healthy, so this pediatrician REFUSED to send me for any imaging tests because ***\"there's no reason to\"***. \n\nSo as of today I have still not yet actually seen a gastroenterologist because no one will refer me to one, and I have not had any x-rays, colonoscopies, endoscopies, etc.\n\nIn normal conditions I am usually a healthy person. Before this started I would dare say my health was at its peak - I was eating very well as I do regularly and running at least 10k (at least 3x per week), I was a competitive horseback rider, I biked everywhere and so on. I was never under a considerable amount of stress. This is very distressing because since this has happened to me, I have not been able to exercise. Despite the \"specialist's\" diet, I have gained 15 pounds since my health failed me. I cannot be anywhere without access to a bathroom. I couldn't even enjoy a Christmas dinner with my family without having to take two bathroom trips. I've tried to continue running and after 20 minutes I would be debilitated with the cramps, twice already I've had an accident. Now I can't make it two minutes without the same result so I have given up.",

If that fails, find a way to come up with the cash for at least an initial consultation with a gastroenterologist.",

About 10 mins after eating the pizza my gut felt upset and I had diarrhea, I decided to take a hot bath.  After about 3 \"phases\" of having diarrhea, I would still feel the pain occasionally, but when I went to poop, nothing but a VERY small amount of yellow liquid.  This pain would occur probably every ten minutes.  After one of the phases of the small amount of yellow liquid, I wiped and after the yellow, I wiped again and saw a VERY VERY VERY small amount of blood.  Like really small.  You know that feeling when you have diarrhea where you feel stinging in the anus?  I had that feeling when I went to go to the washroom and had the yellow liquid.  Now, after eating a piece of toast, and a smoothie later on (which relieved my hunger and felt great, I have no pain). But I did get ONE more phase about an hour and a half later, but still couldn't go poop.  I just instinctively tried to poop every time I felt the pain.  I got a slight amount of smooth stool out, and then I wiped, looked in the toilet, and their was a tiny halo of blood!  Well I assume its blood, it was red and slightly brown with poop.  It was a super thin hollow circle at about 0.6cm in diameter.\n\nWhat's going on?  Any clues?  I don't feel massive pain so obviously I didn't wreck my liver or gall bladder or anything.  My first assumption is that there is blood from the scraping of poop or something idk, but I checked and couldn't see any irregularities in my anus.  Please help!  It would be much appreciated!

I don't know if that is anxiety but the tingling and hunger point to diabetes. Getting a blood test soon hopefully. \n\nI also have weird sensations in my left hand like tingling and buzzing that comes and goes but I think this is unrelated to the above stuff.

You might, you might not, hell you could have something completely unrelated. Depending on the size of the community you might have a diabetes educator and that would be a good next step and if possible a nutritional councilor. Being vegan you have a whole new set of rules to follow regardless of your diabetic status. I have that there is  vegan cooking subreddit and they should be able to help you with recipies etc and I know there is a vegan subreddit (although I have heard vegans complaining about all people do there is bitch about nonvegans so I do not know how helpful that will be. \n\nIn terms of exercise I am assuming you are starting from a completely sedentary life style so doing anything right now no matter how little is an improvement. You can do calestenics (push ups, jumping jacks bodyweight squats etc during commericals when you are at home watching tv). \n\nAssuming you live in a safe neighboorhood use your car's odomoter to make a half mile to one one mile walking route (either a loop or just drive 1/4 mile out and know that when you walk out and then back you made a half mile total). Start walking the half mile once a day three to four times a week. Once this becomes easy (or if it already is I have no idea what your general level of fitness is you may have to start lower or you maybe able to start with long distances) you gradual increase your distance upto a mile then increase your frequence to 4-5 times a week. You can continue to increase your distance or try to increase the time you complete you walk in (intensity). Exercise will generally help with your stress and boredom levels too. \n\nAs aways consult a doctor before starting any exercise program so hopefully when you go to get screened for diabetes you can talk to them about this. Also I am not a doctor nor am I qualified to give any kind of advice over the internet. ",

            "text": "Hello /r/health,\n\nThis is my first post here, but I've been having some breathing troubles recently, and I was wondering if any of you have any idea what it is. I've done a bit of research about it, but my symptoms don't fully match anything that I've read about. I do plan on going to a doctor soon, but I want to fully research this so that I know what I need to bring up to her.\n\nI am experiencing a tightness in chest periodically when I try to breath. It feels almost exactly like what I've heard referred to as 'air hunger.' The frequency of this chest tightness varies a lot day by day. Whenever I have it, though, I constantly have to gasp and yawn. The gasps are mostly voluntary, but I feel like I have to do it to get a full breath. Sometimes it works and gets rid of the tightness for a while, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nIn general, I am in excellent health overall. I exercise two to three times a week for around an hour to an hour and a half (weights/swimming/elliptical). I've been exercising relatively consistently since I was about 15, when I did Tae Kwon Do around 4-5 times a week. I am also a vegetarian, with a pretty good diet overall. I take multi-vitamins and eat a good amount of dairy to make up for what I don't get in meat. I have low blood pressure and heart rate even when I have drunk a decent amount of coffee. When I've been to the doctor's in the past year, they have said that I'm in excellent health.\n\nI did recently find out that I have complex partial seizures (short duration seizures that effect one part of my temporal lobe at a time, causing me to zone out and break my concentration). I was prescribed with Lamictal, a drug that does something to sodium channels. The drugs secondary use is also mood stabilization and prevention of migraines (which I do have). I did have these breathing problems periodically about a year ago, but not to the same extent that I am having them now. The breathing trouble happened a little before I began the titration period, but periodically got worse. When I brought this up to my neurologist, she said that it is unlikely that these problems are due to the medication, since I have had similar problems before. She also did some blood work to test for things like blood acidity and oxygen/co2 ratios. Everything came out normal. She also listened to my breathing and said everything sounded fine. Further, my girlfriend is in med school and every time she has checked my breathing she has said nothing sounds irregular.\n\nI read that similar symptoms are suggestive of asthma, but I don't have the exercise intolerance that is characteristic of asthma. I actually feel much better during/after exercise. \n\nSeveral other disorders that I read about also have exercise intolerance as a primary symptom. \n\nI thought it might have something to do with panic attacks. Anxiety runs pretty strong on my mom's side of the family. My mom, all of my aunts and my great-grandmother all had general anxiety and panic attacks. One of my aunts is agorophobic. The problem is that I have never noticeably felt much anxiety (maybe a little bit during exams, grad school applications, and other stuff like that). Further, my heart rate does not noticeably increase when I have these breathing problems, so it seems like it is not a normal case of panic attacks. \n\nHas anyone heard of something like this? I know that mood and anxiety disorders can manifest in a lot of different ways, but this seems very abnormal. \n\nThe only other complication that I can think of is that I drink a pretty high amount of caffeine everyday. I also drink a lot of water to compensate, though. Further, I have not noticed a difference in my breathing on days when I have drunk a lot of caffeine and those when I've only drunk a little.\n\nThanks for reading, I know the post is very long. I'd very much appreciate any insight or advice.\n\nTL:DR I have breathing problems and can't figure out what is causing them.",

            "text": "I found this article on the Journal of Psychosomatic Research: http://www.jpsychores.com/article/S0022-3999(08)00164-5/abstract\n\nMade an account, and it is still $30 to read the full article. I haven't asked my doctor about this issue, but from what I've already read about tic disorders (I do not have Tourette syndrome).... I'm wondering if that's what it is.\n\nTics can become more frequent when there is stress/anxiety, or hunger, among other reasons. I've had the problem since I was a teenager, so almost 10+ years now. I have it under control and manage the problem managing my stress and level of hunger. When I'm stressed out or hungry I tend to swallow air uncontrollably and it becomes incredibly painful (tight in the stomach)...and eventually goes away once I calm down and/or eat something. It's a 30-60min+ ordeal. These days I have to snack frequently, and I exercise/meditate to manage stress. Tums also helps ease the discomfort, though I don't need to use it since I manage it preemptively. It's something I need to keep in mind every day.\n\nEDIT: Since this is recent, I experienced horrible aerophagia/nausea every morning for nearly a month and a half during a very stressful job I had last fall. It was an absolute nightmare, waking up nauseous and burping, unable to eat anything most of the morning. My current job is busy, but not stressful, so that's not an issue anymore. It was certainly stress related.\n\nAnd if it is psychosomatic, what is the difference between this as a psychosomatic issue vs. a tic? Help?\n\nAnyone else have this issue?\n\nTL;DR: I have aerophagia which is caused by stress and/or hunger. Could this be a tic disorder? Anything else I can do to manage this?",

Go see a psychiatrist - they take the same Board exams as neurologists and they usually are the ones that specialize in tic disorders. Not all tics are Tourette syndrome (TS) - people with TS have to have three types of tics (facial, vocal, and motor complex tics) for at least one year. Psychosomatic disorders are usually anxiety based disorders. Tics tend to be \"impulse control\" disorders and they often co-occur with anxiety disorders (that is why tics are aggravated by stress). People that have motor complex \"tics\" tend to experience them as an \"urge\" to perform a certain motion. They have some level of control, but at some point the \"urge\" overpowers them and they HAVE to do the motion. If you are feeling a \"strong urge\" to swallow air - it is likely to be a tic. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ",

            "text": "I am 20, not overweight (probably a bit underweight actually), avoid processed foods, drink very little alcohol or caffeine, almost no meat and generally feel pretty fit and healthy. I have a cold about once a year and haven\u2019t vomited in almost 10 years so I think my immune system is pretty hot too.\n\nI have had this problem with my stomach for a long time. It has varied in intensity over the years, sometimes I\u2019ll be fine for months and other times I\u2019ll have it once a week. The nature of it has also changed gradually over the years in seemingly random ways which I can\u2019t even begin to describe.\n\nIt usually goes something like this: I eat or drink something which upsets my stomach. It could be a coffee on an empty stomach or a spicy meal, or it could be set off by something as mundane as a cup of tea, eating the same breakfast I eat every day, eating lunch an hour too early, or eating something before bed that I\u2019ve eaten fifty times before without issue. My stomach would then take around 2-4 days to recover. I always assumed it was just indigestion or heartburn but it doesn\u2019t actually cause pain or burning as such, just an unpleasant feeling of something not being right, occasionally it\u2019s sore as well. When it\u2019s very bad I feel a feeling almost like nausea, but somehow totally different from it. Once I\u2019ve set my stomach off I just have to wait for it to get better. Food seems to have little effect on how long I take to recover from that point on.\n\nSometimes it gets set off if I stay up late. I start to get quite hungry around 2am and drink water to keep the hunger at bay until I get to sleep. It made me think it was caused by overacidity, except I am not in any pain with it and it never wakes me up at night. Antacids also seem to have little effect. \n\nI seem to get it much more often when I\u2019m not at home. If I\u2019m at uni or studying abroad it\u2019s a lot worse and more frequent. When I\u2019m at home during summer I have it maybe once mildly in 3-4 months, but it can be almost weekly at uni or abroad. I already eat a pretty plain and healthy diet (I have very little caffeine, very little alcohol, eat meat about once a month, lots of fruit and vegetables and no processed foods) but it seems to not be affected by food much. It also seems to coincide more than coincidence would allow with things like exams and other stressful events and things.\n\nI am a pretty anxious person; specifically I have a phobia of vomiting. I often think I\u2019ll vomit from this problem but I never have before and I have had it hundreds of times over the last 5-10 years so it probably won\u2019t happen. \n\nThere are a few weird things about it which I can\u2019t begin to explain. The main one being the feeling I get in my shins. Often when my stomach is sore I will get a similar tingling kind of feeling in my legs and shins, and sometimes down my arms and across my chest and throat as well. It\u2019s a subtle feeling and not painful in any way, but it\u2019s very odd. Sometimes I get a kind of thick feeling in my throat too. Another weird thing is that having a shower will often make it a bit better. It seems the hot water almost distracts me from the feeling, and then when I get out of the shower the feeling doesn\u2019t come back much. \nAnother weird feeling I used to get, but don\u2019t seem to get anymore is like an electric shock/ burning sensation, almost like lightening, in a very thin line from my stomach to chest area (sounds like acid right) that would last for LITERALLY 0.2 seconds and then go. (Still sound like acid?) I told a doctor this once and he just stared at me completely confused for like ten seconds and then looked at his clipboard and pretty much just wrote \u2018nutter\u2019.\n\nSometimes I will have a terrible hunger feeling like I have to eat NOW, but when I do about 2 minutes later I suddenly feel like I\u2019m going to vomit (I haven\u2019t so far). I keep eating and feel worse afterwards but it settles down after that. I don\u2019t get this one very often though.\n\nThere are over 10 variations of the feeling I get and I have an intimate knowledge of them all and there aren\u2019t even ways for me to describe them. Over time I have developed \u2018rules\u2019 concerning what to eat when I get certain feelings to try and make them go away or avoid making them worse, but over time the feelings and rules have slowly changed, such that the problem I have now seems quite different to how it was when I was 15.\n\nI have been to the doctor\u2019s many times before with this and they never find anything wrong with me so I\u2019ve basically just given up with that.\n\nIt all points towards stress. Sometimes I have been on holidays or spent long periods of time with friends and relaxing at home and I have had no problems whatsoever, despite eating foods that classically cause stomach problems. The only problem if I don\u2019t actually feel stressed, only about this problem!\n\nI apologise for the lack of conciseness here, but it\u2019s very hard for me to properly describe this to anyone. If you have any questions about specific aspects then I will answer them.\n\nI would really appreciate hearing from anyone who has had anything similar or has ideas what it could be or what I could do about it. Nobody else seems to have anything like this and most people just think I\u2019m mad. \n",
